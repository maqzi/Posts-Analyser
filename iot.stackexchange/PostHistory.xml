While I haven't read of such an attack yet, IoT devices can technically be used to sniff the Internet communications or to make use of vulnerabilities on your operating system or the software you have installed to take it over. This can be a bigger risk if your PC has SSH or Telnet port open, and especially if it uses an insecure password. This was actually abused by the Mirai botnet: It attacked telnet ports of devices and tested common passwords to try to take over the device, to include it in the botnet. But this requires a vulnerability in both the IoT device and your computer, so it's unlikely to happen." />

Doing so should be technically safe enough, if we consider that your router doesn't have any vulnerabilities and can separate the network well enough. **Enable** &quot;Client Isolation&quot; (or whatever your router company calls it) if your router supports it (It may be under NAS, Firewall or Wireless menus): &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Client Isolation][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Are IoT devices a major security risk to have on the same network as my PC?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Kinda. While I haven't read of such an attack yet, IoT devices can technically be used to sniff the Internet communications or to make use of vulnerabilities on your operating system or the software you have installed to take it over. This can be a bigger risk if your PC has SSH or Telnet port open, and especially if it uses an insecure password. This was actually abused by the Mirai botnet: It attacked telnet ports of devices and tested common passwords to try to take over the device, to include it in the botnet. But this requires a vulnerability in both the IoT device and your computer, so it's unlikely to happen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/B5Z82.png" />

While a router normally blocks incoming connections, preventing some malicious access, UPnP could allow a malicious program to bypass the firewall entirely. For example, a Trojan horse could install a remote control program on your computer and open a hole for it in your router’s firewall, allowing 24/7 access to your computer from the Internet. If UPnP were disabled, the program couldn’t open the port – although it could bypass the firewall in other ways and phone home." />

Many of the current exploits around IoT devices involve vulnerabilities on the service side, not necessarily on the device itself. Separating the networks between &quot;regular computing&quot; and &quot;IoT&quot; in your home will help mitigate risks to your home computing infrastructure, but will not reduce risks to the devices themselves, or to the Internet in general from devices that have been taken over via vulnerabilities in the services they connect to.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To put it differently - if a bad actor takes over the Nest server network, that actor will be able to access your Nest thermostat whether it is on a separate IoT-only network at your home or on a common network with other compute devices. The separate network will only help protect your home computers in that scenario, it won't help protect anything else.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As to the follow-up question about consumer devices such as phones - that decision will have to be made on a case-by-case basis for your personal use cases, but I would wager to say that most of those devices would end up on the regular compute network, especially if you will be syncing data to/from your mobile device and your computer directly (as opposed to using a cloud-based sync like Google Play or Dropbox)." />

In my professional life, I can leave decisions about hardware, which , if it is off-the-shelf, tends to dictate the choice of the Layer 2 protocol, to the hardware guys. In my private life, I choose by price, support (size of community &amp; availability of forums is **very** important) and a best guess understanding of the spec&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I tend to look for the functioanlity of the overall system.

Generally, unless your server dictates a particular protocol, you have three main choices:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- use TCP, and develop a propeirtary protocol&#xD;&#xA;- use HTTP(S) and develop a [RESTful][5] interface (go [AJAX][6] if you want asynchronous, non-blocking, for instance if you multi-thread). Unless you have many transactions, are time critical, or your server operations will take a long time, you can get away with a blocking interface. &#xD;&#xA;- choose one of the plethora of IoT &quot;standards&quot;. I would only advise this if your device provides strong support for one particular protocol, or your server demands it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope that I understood your question correctly.

There is always some&#xD;&#xA;&gt; agent present in an IoT application. Typically the agent reads the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; status from sensors or local connectivity to an asset, applies some&#xD;&#xA;&gt; rules or logic about how often the sender has to aggregate the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; information, and then sends the information over a long-haul&#xD;&#xA;&gt; communications network to the server. This process can operate in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; reverse as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is my assumption this agent consist of connectivity information such as IP address, server name, SSID type information to aid connectivity.

In my professional life, I can leave decisions about hardware, which , if it is off-the-shelf, tends to dictate the choice of the Layer 2 protocol, to the hardware guys. In my private life, I choose by price, support (size of community &amp; availability of forums is **very** important) and a best guess understanding of the spec&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I tend to look for the functionality of the overall system. For instance, for [mesh networks][2], there are some excellent Zigbee solutions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For example, do some signals work better long-range and some better in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;noisy&quot; environments?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For long-range, I cannot recommend highly enough [Flutter][3] with a 1km/half mile range, as oppsed to 100m.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It costs only US $20, and here is a picture to give you some idea of the range &#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][4]][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Noisy environments is not my speciality - I leave that to the hardware guys, sorry - but you might want to look into things like the [Shannon limit][5], which is a software, as opposed to hardware, approach to noise (also, [Forward Error Correction][6], etc)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I said, those protocols are &quot;low level&quot; stuff to me, as an application developer (layer 3 guy, actually, which is a little lower).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yes, it is important that you consider that sort of thing, but many will just say &quot;I know, I will go with Raspberry PI (or whatever)&quot; and accept whatever it offers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After that, when developing your application, you need to decide which higher level protocol to use. Generally, unless your server dictates a particular protocol, you have three main choices:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- use TCP, and develop a propeirtary protocol&#xD;&#xA;- use HTTP(S) and develop a [RESTful][7] interface (go [AJAX][8] if you want asynchronous, non-blocking, for instance if you multi-thread). Unless you have many transactions, are time critical, or your server operations will take a long time, you can get away with a blocking interface. &#xD;&#xA;- choose one of the plethora of IoT &quot;standards&quot;. I would only advise this if your device provides strong support for one particular protocol, or your server demands it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope that I understood your question correctly.

So **change all the passwords**. Pick a unique, random password for every device and write it down on paper (paper is safe from remote attackers and hard drive failures). 12 *random* (i.e. computer-generated) lowercase letters represent a good compromise between security and being hard to type. Each device should have a different password so that breaking one doesn't let the attacker break all of them. Enter the passwords in a password manager and use that password manager in the computers you use to control the devices.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the device has different authorization channels, for example an administration password and a day-to-day usage password, use different passwords for both and only record the administration password on selected devices.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second generic security measure is to ensure that all your devices are behind a firewall or at least a NAT device. A typical home router is sufficient, but you should turn off UPnP which can allow inadvertent back channels from the outside. The goal is to ensures that there's no direct way to connect from the Internet to the device. Connections should always go through a gateway that itself requires authentication to cross, and that you keep patched with any security updates.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You should also apply security updates on all the devices… if they exist at all, which can be a problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Unless the device is too resource-constrained to support TLS, if you get down to the level of AES, [you're doing it wrong](https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blog/2009/july/if-youre-typing-the-letters-a-e-s-into-your-code-youre-doing-it-wrong/). #1 mistake is to encrypt and forget to authenticate — if you have an encrypted channel between your server and a man-in-the-middle, instead of an encrypted channel between your server and your device, then encryption hasn't provided any benefit. If you can't use TLS, make sure that whatever protocol you're using **authenticates everything**, and encrypts what needs to be confidential.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To use TLS securely, think about what guarantees you need to have, from the point of view of each participant. Generally the device needs to know that it's talking to the legitimate server. That means that it must check the server's certificate. The device must have the X.509 certificate of a certificate authority recorded as trusted; this requires storage that can't be modified by an attacker, but it doesn't require any confidentiality of the storage. Note that you shouldn't hard-code the server's certificate directly, because that wouldn't let you easily replace that certificate if it's compromised. Instead, the device stores the expected *identity* (host name) of the server, and the certificate of a certificate authority that guarantees that a certain public key belongs to the expected host name. Once again, don't reinvent the wheel, rely on the certificate checking provided by your TLS library or application.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the server needs to know that it's talking to a legitimate client, then each client needs to have its own client certificate. That requires confidential storage on the client. Pass the client certificate to the TLS session opening function from your TLS library, or set it in the application configuration.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That takes care of securing the communication between your server and your device. If the mobile application can talk to the device directly (e.g. to allow disconnected operation while it's on the local wifi network), you need to first perform pairing between the smart switch and the mobile phone. Pairing means an exchange of keys, preferably an exchange of public keys if resources permit, otherwise an agreement of secret keys. The goal of this pairing is to ensure that each device knows who it's talking to.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You'll need to secure the control channel as well, whether it goes directly from the mobile device to the smart switch or via a server. Think about authorization: are there different levels of access to the switch, e.g. a control level that allows doing reconfiguration and a basic channel that just allows on/off switching? This is generally handled by an authentication step after establishing the secure channel (TLS if possible).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another consideration is firmware updates. That's a tricky one: on the one hand, there's no such thing as absolute security, so you will have security patches to apply now and then. On the other hand, a firmware upgrade mechanism is a complex thing and might itself have bugs. At the very least, make sure that your firmware upgrades are signed. Relying purely on the security of the communication channel for upgrades is dodgy, because the trusted based for a secure channel is larger than for a static security verification, and sometimes you might want to apply firmware updates without a network connection. In addition to verifying the signature, ideally you should have some protection against rollback, so that an adversary can't just push an “update” to version 1 on a system running version 2 and then exploit the security hole that version 2 patched.&#xD;&#xA;" />

More often than not, an OEM will control the libraries for development of the software to control the parameters of the device. Whereas, the OEM may choose any of the popular communication protocols (MQTT, HTTP, etc.) to publish the values read. Typically, integration of these two is the space where a System Integrator comes in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, an agent could be running on a Windows desktop to read the rpm of the fan every 5 seconds.

However, Wi-Fi is more secure, has a higher range and bandwidth but, of course, costs more.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So the question is: At the dawn of a project, how can one decide which one will be the more suitable for the task?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To be a little more specific, the project will be a smart home of connected devices. As further clarification was requested.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The system specifications:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - No HD cameras in any device.&#xD;&#xA; - Purpose is to have connected all the locks, both windows and enterance doors and even dog doors.&#xD;&#xA; - All light switch should be connected with feedback information about the current state of the particular lamp. (Switches can be controlled remotely and manually as well.)&#xD;&#xA; - Be able to handle proximity sensors several one per room.&#xD;&#xA; - I want the system to be able to handle smart air conditioners (these should be controlled remotely and be able to give feedback about temperature and humidity values.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general I have a lot of devices with low bandwidth requirements and the main goal is to has a system as much scalable as possible. So if I move to a twice as big house which needs almost twice as much sensors, I want it to be the easiest to install the additional ones.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.diffen.com/difference/Bluetooth_vs_Wifi&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/VcRBo.png" />

If a PING message is not received by the server then it may disconnect you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;if the Client disconnects after subscription, then a server cannot forward messages to it because it is the Client that should establish conenction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the client is disconnected then yes, it will not receive messages, however there are features in MQTT that work around this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the client connects to the server with the 'Clean session' flag set to false, then the server will remember the subscription for that client ID. Once the client reconnects, it will not need to re-subscribe as the server will have remembered it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore, you can subscribe using QoS Level 1 or 2. With these QoS Levels, the Server will store messages and wait for the client to reconnect before sending them on. This way, even if the client disconnects and reconnects they will still receive all published messages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This site has some good resources explaining the MQTT protocol: http://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-essentials-part-6-mqtt-quality-of-service-levels" />

Here are some more general thoughts/philosophies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; **1. A DMZ is your friend** - In almost every case where you have a service facing an external network a DMZ (see a.) will be very beneficial. In this case it will both minimize the attack surface and minimize the damage. By limiting the number of devices in the DMZ to only the ones that need external access you limit the attack surface. Also the DMZ will make it much harder for anyone to access your core network, thus minimizing the damage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  **2. Whitelist, don't Blacklist** - By default every single protocol, port and internal connection should be blocked by default. This blocking should be setup in the device (if possible), the firewall and the router. Only enable options that you are actively using and only for the devices that need one. If you know and must use a protocol for an IoT device that is weak (for example devices that are affected by Mirai) you should setup a device (like a RaspberryPi) to act as relay. You completely isolate the device from the network and only communicate with it via a secure protocol (ssh, vpn etc.) that the RaspberryPi transforms into the protocol that the device needs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;a. http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/3667/what-is-the-real-function-and-use-of-a-dmz-on-a-network" />

One of my biggest headaches is turning on the ones I need without climbing under my desk and plugging in a lot of wires. I looked at IoT controlled power switches but that is going to get very expensive very fast for a large number of distributed devices (really, a $20 power switch for a $5 micro computer?). Obviously once they are deployed in large numbers (~100 at a site) the desk climbing will no longer be an option.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would also like to be able to turn them on (from fully off) from anywhere that there is internet.

Here are some more general thoughts/philosophies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; **1. A DMZ is your friend** - In almost every case where you have a service facing an external network a DMZ (see a.) will be very beneficial. In this case it will both minimize the attack surface and minimize the damage. By limiting the number of devices in the DMZ to only the ones that need external access you limit the attack surface. Also the DMZ will make it much harder for anyone to access your core network, thus minimizing the damage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  **2. Whitelist, don't Blacklist** - By default every single protocol, port and internal connection should be blocked by default. This blocking should be setup in the device (if possible), the firewall and the router. Only enable options that you are actively using and only for the devices that need one. If you know and must use a protocol for an IoT device that is weak (for example devices that are affected by Mirai) you should setup a device (like a RaspberryPi) to act as relay. You completely isolate the device from the network and only communicate with it via a secure protocol (ssh, vpn etc.) that the RaspberryPi transforms into the protocol that the device needs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[About DMZ from Security.SE][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/3667/what-is-the-real-function-and-use-of-a-dmz-on-a-network" />

It appears to be a proprietary piece of software which vendors install on each device connecting to the cloud. Below are two images of software stacks with references to **Agent**. A portion of the of software stack reside in the microcontroller.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![IOT Agent - 1][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![IOT Agent][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also here is very broad explanation Thingworx blog&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; An agent is an embedded program that runs on or near an IoT device and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; reports the status of some asset or environment. There is always some&#xD;&#xA;&gt; agent present in an IoT application. Typically the agent reads the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; status from sensors or local connectivity to an asset, applies some&#xD;&#xA;&gt; rules or logic about how often the sender has to aggregate the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; information, and then sends the information over a long-haul&#xD;&#xA;&gt; communications network to the server. This process can operate in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; reverse as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is my assumption this agent consist of connectivity information such as IP address, server name, SSID type information to aid connectivity. Does these Embedded Agents have other functionality beyond providing connectivity? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**References:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [Top 49 Tools For The Internet of Things][3]&#xD;&#xA; - [The Internet of Things, “Smart” Products Demand a Smart Strategy][4] &#xD;&#xA; - [Foundational Elements of an IoT Solution,The Edge, The Cloud, and Application Development][5]&#xD;&#xA; - [New Life for Embedded Systems in the INTERNET OF THINGS][6]&#xD;&#xA; - [The Edge Of The Iot][7]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/o2bSz.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/zpIDQ.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://blog.profitbricks.com/top-49-tools-internet-of-things/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.woodsidecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/WCP-IOT-M_and_A-REPORT-2015-21.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.oreilly.com/iot/free/foundational-elements-of-an-iot-solution.csp&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://www.windriver.com/whitepapers/device-cloud/Wind-River-Helix-Device-Cloud-WP.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://marketplace.thingworx.com/thingworx/home/developer/iot-guide/the-edge-of-the-iot" />

The other thing Mirai does is to block ports to avoid monitoring tools to detect it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These two features can be looked for. The first needs a very sophisticated network traffic monitoring solution and intricate knowledge about what kind of traffic you expect in your network. If your IoT device does not communicate via a WiFi connection but over 3G or other mobile telecommunication standards you are pretty much out of luck because you cannot monitor those. At least not easily and in most jurisdictions not legally.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second Mirai feature is the thing Incapsula also scans for. If the ports are closed there is a *possible* Mirai infection. Since rebooting temporarily frees the device from Mirai's clutches the change in port availability in the time after a reboot can be taken as a very likely sign that the device has been compromised.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Do keep in mind, that Incapsula does not provide certainty but only gives your information about devices that are possible targets and devices that *might have been* infected. This is why it is important to realize that the Mirai however powerful attacks it can field it is not an unbeatable enemy on a small scope, it's even easy to prevent infections.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The next two sections will show that detecting is way too much effort compared to securing a device in the first place or securing your device on a hunch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Recapturing your device**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, Mirai acts as an end point for a bot net and the worm is not changing the persistent memory of the IoT device. I.e. the firm ware is not infected. This is the reason why *a reboot and an immediate password change* gives you back control over your device.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Infected systems can be cleaned by rebooting them, but since scanning for these devices happens at a constant rate, it’s possible for them to be reinfected within minutes of a reboot. This means users have to change the default password immediately after rebooting, or prevent the device from accessing the internet until they can reset the firmware and change the password locally.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Webroot.com: Source Code for Mirai IoT Malware Released][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Prevent being compromised in the first place**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Mirai does not hack your devices!* &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Mirai continuously scans the internet for IoT devices and logs into them using the factory default or hard-coded usernames and passwords.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Webroot.com: Source Code for Mirai IoT Malware Released][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Mirai uses factory default logins to compromise your devices.

For example, HTML is really a relaxed form of XML that conveys content with a dynamic structure, structure that could be considered an aspect of the content.  You can distinguish the content of a table from the table itself, but the fact that the content is tabular data with specific relations is integral to the content; if I just took each cell and transmitted it all as one long string, that structure and those relationships are gone, and so I have lost information and isn't that content?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's consider an 8 byte message that might constitute some tabluar data.  If I use a very static protocol, I could, minimally, transmit that with no additional overhead simply by defining a protocol like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Each message is exactly 8 bytes, so we don't need to indicate the length or include any terminating sequence.&#xD;&#xA;- The eight bytes are always taken to refer to a 2 x 2 grid where each cell contains a 16-bit value.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If all my messages are exactly like that, using XML or HTML or XMPP might be considered silly -- I am wasting bandwidth on structural components that are always the same and predetermined anyway, and wasting corresponding computation time at both ends creating and parsing it.  A minimal, proper HTML page that contains just a 2 x 2 table with a couple of characters in each cell is probably going to be at least 100 bytes to accommodate the formatting and protocol overhead.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, if not all my messages are exactly that, then specifying what kind of message it is may not be a literal part of the &quot;payload&quot; but it is a necessary component, content-wise.  I could do that with just an extra two bytes and introduce much more dynamism:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Messages are now variable length, 0-255 bytes, and the first byte indicates the length.&#xD;&#xA;- There are (up to) 255 codes for different predefined message types, one of which is &quot;2 x 2 table&quot;, that's the second byte.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now my 8 bytes of table content require 2 bytes of overhead, but there is a much wider range of possibilities in terms of what kinds of messages can be sent with this custom protocol.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's still no where close to the possibilities of an HTML page or [XML namespace][1] specification (or set thereof, which is [what XMPP essentially is][2]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, based on that, if mostly what you are doing is sending simple 8 byte messages, XMPP is probably overkill.  However, not necessarily that much.  The claim that &quot;a single request/response exchange to send one byte of data from an IOT CONNECTED DEVICE to the server is more than 0.5 kB&quot; seems to me, glancing at [the relevant RFC][3], to be a potential exaggeration (but n.b., all I did is glance at it, I've never implemented or used XMPP).  I don't doubt you could construct an example of such, but that it is probably not a *minimal* example.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since the protocol is TCP oriented, establishing &quot;an XML stream qualified by the 'jabber:client' namespace&quot; only needs to be considered part of the message if we are doing one off things -- device contacts a server to send 8 bytes to, sends the data, disconnects.  If the relationship is more persistent, which is would often be in an IoT context, then we can assume the device already has an established connection to the destination.  In this case, if the ultimate destination of the message is the server (as opposed to another client the server is going to pass the message on to), then the protocol overhead is potentially minimal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;message&gt;&lt;body&gt;8 bytes.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/message&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A measly 33 bytes of &quot;overhead&quot;.

For example, HTML is really a relaxed form of XML that conveys content with a dynamic structure, structure that could be considered an aspect of the content.  You can distinguish the content of a table from the table itself, but the fact that the content is tabular data with specific relations is integral to the content; if I just took each cell and transmitted it all as one long string, that structure and those relationships are gone, and so I have lost information and isn't that content?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's consider an 8 byte message that might constitute some tabluar data.  If I use a very static protocol, I could, minimally, transmit that with no additional overhead simply by defining a protocol like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Each message is exactly 8 bytes, so we don't need to indicate the length or include any terminating sequence.&#xD;&#xA;- The eight bytes are always taken to refer to a 2 x 2 grid where each cell contains a 16-bit value.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If all my messages are exactly like that, using XML or HTML or XMPP might be considered silly -- I am wasting bandwidth on structural components that are always the same and predetermined anyway, and wasting corresponding computation time at both ends creating and parsing it.  A minimal, proper HTML page that contains just a 2 x 2 table with a couple of characters in each cell is probably going to be at least 100 bytes to accommodate the formatting and protocol overhead.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, if not all my messages are exactly that, then specifying what kind of message it is may not be a literal part of the &quot;payload&quot; but it is a necessary component, content-wise.  I could do that with just an extra two bytes and introduce much more dynamism:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Messages are now variable length, 0-255 bytes, and the first byte indicates the length.&#xD;&#xA;- There are (up to) 255 codes for different predefined message types, one of which is &quot;2 x 2 table&quot;, that's the second byte.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now my 8 bytes of table content require 2 bytes of overhead, but there is a much wider range of possibilities in terms of what kinds of messages can be sent with this custom protocol.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's still no where close to the possibilities of an HTML page or [XML namespace][1] specification (or set thereof, which is [what XMPP essentially is][2]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, based on that, if mostly what you are doing is sending simple 8 byte messages, XMPP is probably overkill.  However, not necessarily that much.  The claim that &quot;a single request/response exchange to send one byte of data from an IOT CONNECTED DEVICE to the server is more than 0.5 kB&quot; seems to me, glancing at [the relevant RFC][3], to be a potential exaggeration (but n.b., all I did is glance at it, I've never implemented or used XMPP).  I don't doubt you could construct an example of such, but that is probably not a *minimal* example.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since the protocol is TCP oriented, establishing &quot;an XML stream qualified by the 'jabber:client' namespace&quot; only needs to be considered part of the message if we are doing one off things -- device contacts a server to send 8 bytes to, sends the data, disconnects.  If the relationship is more persistent, which it would often be in an IoT context, then we can assume the device already has an established connection to the destination.  In this case, if the ultimate destination of the message is the server (as opposed to another client the server is going to pass the message on to), then the protocol overhead is potentially minimal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;message&gt;&lt;body&gt;8 bytes.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/message&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A measly 33 bytes of &quot;overhead&quot;.  It is worth pointing out here that XML is text, and so if your messages are often binary, then it is going to become much less appropriate, because that data needs to be encoded (e.g., to [base64][4]), which adds further overhead and computational requirements.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, ultimately:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Does XMPP have a large overhead for IoT devices sending short, frequent messages?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If there is a persistent connection and the messages are largely unstructured, I don't think so.  However, if you don't need what it offers (the dynamism with regard to structure), then there are probably more appropriate methodologies. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pursuit to that, if we have a context where a single central server is processing and/or relying messages between a variety of devices, even though what any one of those devices is doing may always be simple and straightforward, a protocol which can encapsulates a variety of messages would still be useful.  If a client device has limited resources, we can hardcode much of the protocol, and wrapping each message from that end becomes a very simple task; I believe many IoT devices which deploy HTTP servers do that (which is the inverse of &quot;simple clients, complex server&quot;).  Those servers cannot handle any kind of HTTP request (except via preformatted rejection) and have a very well defined, focused set of things thing will do and responses they will send, but since they none-the-less function correctly as HTTP servers, implementing clients across a very broad range of commonplace devices (including smartphones and PCs) is simple.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_namespace#Namespace_names&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://xmpp.org/registrar/namespaces.html&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6120#section-8&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64" />

While a router normally blocks incoming connections, preventing some malicious access, UPnP could allow a malicious program to bypass the firewall entirely. For example, a Trojan horse could install a remote control program on your computer and open a hole for it in your router’s firewall, allowing 24/7 access to your computer from the Internet. If UPnP were disabled, the program couldn’t open the port – although it could bypass the firewall in other ways and phone home." />

For example, HTML is really a relaxed form of XML that conveys content with a dynamic structure, structure that could be considered an aspect of the content.  You can distinguish the content of a table from the table itself, but the fact that the content is tabular data with specific relations is integral to the content; if I just took each cell and transmitted it all as one long string, that structure and those relationships are gone, and so I have lost information and isn't that content?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's consider an 8 byte message that might constitute some tabluar data.  If I use a very static protocol, I could, minimally, transmit that with no additional overhead simply by defining a protocol like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Each message is exactly 8 bytes, so we don't need to indicate the length or include any terminating sequence.&#xD;&#xA;- The eight bytes are always taken to refer to a 2 x 2 grid where each cell contains a 16-bit value.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If all my messages are exactly like that, using XML or HTML or XMPP might be considered silly -- I am wasting bandwidth on structural components that are always the same and predetermined anyway, and wasting corresponding computation time at both ends creating and parsing it.  A minimal, proper HTML page that contains just a 2 x 2 table with a couple of characters in each cell is probably going to be at least 100 bytes to accommodate the formatting and protocol overhead.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, if not all my messages are exactly that, then specifying what kind of message it is may not be a literal part of the &quot;payload&quot; but it is a necessary component, content-wise.  I could do that with just an extra two bytes and introduce much more dynamism:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Messages are now variable length, 0-255 bytes, and the first byte indicates the length.&#xD;&#xA;- There are (up to) 256 codes for different predefined message types, one of which is &quot;2 x 2 table&quot;, that's the second byte.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now my 8 bytes of table content require 2 bytes of overhead, but there is a much wider range of possibilities in terms of what kinds of messages can be sent with this custom protocol.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's still no where close to the possibilities of an HTML page or [XML namespace][1] specification (or set thereof, which is [what XMPP essentially is][2]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, based on that, if mostly what you are doing is sending simple 8 byte messages, XMPP is probably overkill.  However, not necessarily that much.  The claim that &quot;a single request/response exchange to send one byte of data from an IOT CONNECTED DEVICE to the server is more than 0.5 kB&quot; seems to me, glancing at [the relevant RFC][3], to be a potential exaggeration (but n.b., all I did is glance at it, I've never implemented or used XMPP).  I don't doubt you could construct an example of such, but that is probably not a *minimal* example.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since the protocol is TCP oriented, establishing &quot;an XML stream qualified by the 'jabber:client' namespace&quot; only needs to be considered part of the message if we are doing one off things -- device contacts a server to send 8 bytes to, sends the data, disconnects.  If the relationship is more persistent, which it would often be in an IoT context, then we can assume the device already has an established connection to the destination.  In this case, if the ultimate destination of the message is the server (as opposed to another client the server is going to pass the message on to), then the protocol overhead is potentially minimal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;message&gt;&lt;body&gt;8 bytes.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/message&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A measly 33 bytes of &quot;overhead&quot;.  It is worth pointing out here that XML is text, and so if your messages are often binary, then it is going to become much less appropriate, because that data needs to be encoded (e.g., to [base64][4]), which adds further overhead and computational requirements.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, ultimately:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Does XMPP have a large overhead for IoT devices sending short, frequent messages?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If there is a persistent connection and the messages are largely unstructured, I don't think so.  However, if you don't need what it offers (the dynamism with regard to structure), then there are probably more appropriate methodologies. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pursuit to that, if we have a context where a single central server is processing and/or relying messages between a variety of devices, even though what any one of those devices is doing may always be simple and straightforward, a protocol which can encapsulate a variety of messages would still be useful.  If a client device has limited resources, we can hardcode much of the protocol, and wrapping each message from that end becomes a very simple task; I believe many IoT devices which deploy HTTP servers do that (which is the inverse of &quot;simple clients, complex server&quot;).  Those servers cannot handle any kind of HTTP request (except via preformatted rejection) and have a very well defined, focused set of things thing will do and responses they will send, but since they none-the-less function correctly as HTTP servers, implementing clients across a very broad range of commonplace devices (including smartphones and PCs) is simple.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_namespace#Namespace_names&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://xmpp.org/registrar/namespaces.html&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6120#section-8&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64" />

It is worth pointing out here that XML is text, and so if your messages are often binary, then it is going to become much less appropriate, because that data needs to be encoded (e.g., to [base64][4]), which adds further overhead and computational requirements.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, ultimately:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Does XMPP have a large overhead for IoT devices sending short, frequent messages?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If there is a persistent connection and the messages are largely unstructured, I don't think so. However, if you don't need what it offers (the dynamism with regard to structure), then there are probably more appropriate methodologies. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pursuit to that, if we have a context where a single central server is processing and/or relying messages between a variety of devices, even though what any one of those devices is doing may always be simple and straightforward, a protocol which can encapsulate a variety of messages would still be useful.  If a client device has limited resources, we can hardcode much of the protocol, and wrapping each message from that end becomes a very simple task; I believe many IoT devices which deploy HTTP servers do that (which is the inverse of &quot;simple clients, complex server&quot;).  Those servers cannot handle any kind of HTTP request (except via preformatted rejection) and have a very well defined, focused set of things thing will do and responses they will send, but since they none-the-less function correctly as HTTP servers, implementing clients across a very broad range of commonplace devices (including smartphones and PCs) is simple.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_namespace#Namespace_names&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://xmpp.org/registrar/namespaces.html&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6120#section-8&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64" />

An Atmel ATmega128 is used with 128 Kbytes of programmable flash memory, 4 Kbytes of SRAM, and thirty-two  8-bit general purpose registers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Three encryption implementations are compared: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. *RAM-minimizing* &#xD;&#xA;&gt; These  implementations  avoid  the&#xD;&#xA;use of RAM to store round keys by including the pre-expanded round keys&#xD;&#xA;in the  flash program memory.

The  key,  stored  in   flash,  is  used  to  generate  the&#xD;&#xA;round keys which are subsequently stored in RAM.&#xD;&#xA; 3. *Flash-minimizing*&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The key schedule is included here.&#xD;&#xA;Space  limitations  mean  we  can  only  provide  an  incomplete  description  of&#xD;&#xA;these implementations. However, it should be noted that the previous two&#xD;&#xA;types of implementations already have very modest code sizes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;****************************************&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To compare different cyphers a performance efficiency measure - *rank* - is used.

Before activating the new image, you can write the whole thing, verify it and potentially retry.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However this _is_ an expensive/reliable strategy and there are things you can do to reduce the overhead. Low level support for OTA updates may also come as part of the device firmware or OS, so you can avoid rolling-your-own unless you want to learn. This feature might be described as `FOTA`.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Partitioning your code base allows for incremental updates, best case the bootloader is able to bring up the network connection, download and verify code without needing any fall-back user code. With a local gateway, management of this task can be delegated from the low-cost endpoints.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many devices have a small amount of word-erase flash, and even failing this you can usually _set_ bits without needing to erase a whole block. These features can be used to manipulate jump tables and stitch together code which is updated in block sizes chunks. Even if you initially planned for a full A/B code space, you might need to fall back to a more complex scheme when the codebase grows too much.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To clarify the functionality which can be achieved with a sophisticated firmware-over-the-air solution, the bootloader and potentially a primary communication stack can remain resident whilst the full remaining user application space is re-flashed. This doesn't need any overhead (particularly if the block partitioning is soft). In the scenario where the communication stack needs to be upgraded, the region generally used for application code can be temporarily used during download and verification. Achieving this requires some support in the SoC, but 2nd and 3rd generation devices designed with this in mind do exist already." />

When “Device alert” is enabled your TrackR device will sound off when the bluetooth connection betwen your TrackR and phone is off. Conversely, when &quot;Phone alert&quot; is enabled your phone will begin to ring when bluetooth connection between your TrackR and phone is lost. To remedy this issue you can turn off phone and device alerts from the TrackR app. To turn off the alerts please follow these steps:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;1. Open the TrackR app&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;2. Click the icon in the top right corner of the app. This icon will look like 3 blocks stacked on top of each other.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;3.

In other words, the IoT *allows objects to be sensed and/or controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure*&lt;sup&gt;[Harvard][3]&lt;/sup&gt; by its direct integration into the physical world computer-based systems in order to provide improved efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit. The device should be able to operate to some extent interactively and autonomously.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other used names for such devices are &quot;connected devices&quot;, [&quot;smart devices&quot;][4], Internet of Everything, Machine-to-Machine communications or Industrial Internet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Internet of Things (IoT) has been also defined by [IoT-GSI][5] (The Global Standards Initiative on Internet of Things) in [Recommendation ITU-T Y.2060 (06/2012)][6] which clarifies the concept and scope of the IoT, identifies the fundamental characteristics and high-level requirements of the IoT.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The IoT, things are objects of the physical world (physical things) or of the information world (virtual world) which are capable of being identified and integrated into communication networks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Physical things exist in the physical world and are capable of being sensed, actuated and connected.&#xD;&#xA;Examples of physical things include the surrounding environment, industrial robots, goods and electrical equipment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The minimum requirement of the devices in the IoT is their support of communication capabilities.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, we can classify the IoT devices into the following groups:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Data-carrying device&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; A data-carrying device is attached to a physical thing to indirectly&#xD;&#xA;connect the physical thing with the communication networks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Data-capturing device&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; A data-capturing device refers to a reader/writer device with the&#xD;&#xA;capability to interact with physical things. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Sensing and actuating device&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; A sensing and actuating device may detect or measure&#xD;&#xA;information related to the surrounding environment and convert it into digital electronic signals. It may also convert digital electronic signals from the information networks into operations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- General device&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; A general device has embedded processing and communication capabilities&#xD;&#xA;and may communicate with the communication networks via wired or wireless&#xD;&#xA;technologies.

As an XML-based protocol, XMPP is very verbose, even more so than HTTP, and has heavy data overhead. A single request/response exchange to send one byte of data from an IOT CONNECTED DEVICE to the server is more than 0.5 kB.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; There is a draft specification that would compress XMPP using an XML encoding called efficient XML Interchange (EXI). But even with EXI, the same one byte of data gets hundreds of bytes of protocol overhead from XMPP alone. EXI is also a much harder format to process than other options now available. Because of these inherent problems, it is generally recommended to avoid using XMPP in embedded IoT applications.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, XMPP [promotes itself as suitable for IoT applications](http://xmpp.org/uses/internet-of-things.html) (although it doesn't specifically say that it's low-overhead), so it seems odd that such a large, seemingly verbose protocol would be recommended/promoted for IoT devices.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is the overhead of XMPP really as large as the source suggests for small amounts of data? For example, how much overhead would there be when sending an 8-byte message? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, is the overhead so great if [**EXI**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_XML_Interchange) compression is used (as mentioned in the source)? Would this also come with some pitfalls?&#xD;&#xA;" />

Simply put, call something an IoT device where it's obvious that the device has some form of autonomy and interaction with its environment; not just any particular class of item." />

Wi-Fi HaLow’s range is nearly twice that of today’s Wi-Fi, and will not only be capable of transmitting signals further, but also providing a more robust connection in challenging environments where the ability to more easily penetrate walls or other barriers is an important consideration.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, as mentioned in the linked source, HaLow operates in the 900MHz frequency, which, according to [eWeek](http://www.eweek.com/networking/halow-wifi-standard-brings-its-own-set-of-highs-and-lows-2.html), is an unlicensed frequency:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Unfortunately, the new HaLow standard doesn't have its frequencies to itself. Because the 900MHz band is shared with other licensed services, the new WiFi band is subject to interference from other users and there is no remedy when that interference happens.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For example, if a ham radio operator next door goes on the air with a powerful signal that wipes out your smart thermostat, you're out of luck. Because you're an unlicensed service, you're required to accept that interference.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; However, if your smart thermostat happens to cause interference to that ham radio operator next door, then you're required to stop doing it. As an unlicensed user, you have few rights to the spectrum if someone else wants to use it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Presumably this is related to the [FCC rules](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b9648f6ec90b7ebfad611bf26c88c34&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt47.1.15&amp;rgn=div5#se47.1.15_119) which are commonly seen on RF products:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This device complies with part 15 of the FCC Rules. Operation is subject to the following two conditions: (1) This device may not cause harmful interference, and (2) this device must accept any interference received, including interference that may cause undesired operation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Does this make HaLow too problematic for use as a communication method? If I wished to design a device using HaLow, how could I avoid interference which would require me to stop broadcasting?" />

Text="By far the easiest route is to buy an exisiting product here which is sufficiently open that you can use a standard RF module to control them. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is equivalent to having an MCU and switch integrated (so gives you good autonomy) and also avoids any problems with the appearance or safety of the result. You are of course then stuck with the manuracturer's on-air protocol unless you try and reverse engineer their firmware on the switches (which are probably going to be heavily cost optimised).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you use the LightWaveRF switches, all you need is a £1 433 MHz transmit module, and an arduino or similar to send the &#xD;&#xA;[protocol described here][1]. These switches handle all the mains isolation, and provide capacitive touch controls on the switch. You can also use the standard remote control to provide inputs to your control hub if you use a receive module. Since there are several channels available, you could use the remote to provide input to the hub, and use the hub to relay the commands on a 2nd channel.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;433 MHz modules are simple to repurpose because the RF protocol is insecure.

Why? Because DARPA wanted it to work even if half the United States were bombed into oblivion if the cold war was going hot. The military wanted a highly reliable network that is not dependent on any single node. Meshing or at least partial meshing your network nodes will give you that reliability. The major drawback of (wired) mesh networks is that they are not very cost efficient. They cost a lot. Cabling every component to every other component is just too expensive. So the WAN backbone of the Internet of Things is already a *wired* mesh network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Star topology is needs just one cable per node, while meshing uses up to n*(n-1)/2 for a full mesh. The cabling for mesh networks gets a lot more expensive very fast. Thus, star topology emerged as the dominant standard.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Now (mostly) new, wireless mesh networks**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Establishing *wireless* mesh networks circumvents the major drawback of *wired* mesh networks. There is no cabling cost to create a wireless mesh network. Thus, creating wireless mesh networks pairs the reliability network creators always wanted with the low cost of few cables and of course all the other advantages of being wireless.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However there are still a few drawbacks of mesh networks. Nodes have to be relatively smart for the routing compared to simply connecting to one central node. ZigBee uses [Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing][1], which requires routing tables at each node. Also a certain duplex capability of the nodes is required to make the network efficient. Bringing that on a low-cost, wireless-capable microchip took some time. Today we have those chips.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For a mesh network to work properly there have to be enough nodes. It actually gets more efficient with more nodes (that connect to at least two existing ones). Thus, the Internet of Things were everything can act as a node is an obvious match for meshed networks. While other topologies would possibly clog up with more nodes mesh networks really start to shine there and get faster and more reliable the more nodes are added.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Your 10-20 node network**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For a smart home setting with one or two dozen devices there are a few things to consider regarding topology. Firstly, ZigBee actually supports star topology as well. Secondly, any sort of distance vector routing usually works with weighted vector values. Thus, in a smart home setting the direct connection could very well be rated highest and you'll end up with a defact star topology even when it's configured as a mesh.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Only the device that are out of range of a central component like a Hue Bridge (or rate the direct connection bad enough) will even make use of the mesh topology. For these devices **mesh networking is essentially a low latency range extension** for your network. Thus, you don't have to buy another central node. That saves money. So the same thing that killed wide spread wired mesh networks before makes wireless mesh networks so attractive today.

Range extension was already mention which the mesh network as each device in the network will help make the network bigger than each device would be alone. Another important aspect is how the messages are routed. While some devices will remain stationary, others may be moved around. This could make routing messages in a typical way difficult, but a mesh network will be able to handle it better as all the nodes will be able to look for the device in question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A practical example of this in work is in a ZWave network you can rediscover all the nodes in your network so the controller and other nodes can figure out the best path for messages and which nodes can talk to which with and without relaying the message on a different device.

One of the problems with this prototype was that the configuration required a considerable amount power. Thus, it could not overcome the benefits of the existing lower power device which could last for over 2 to 10 years depending on choice of battery and usage frequency. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Depending on the application, the current product uses a 6V DC battery with a capacity between 1400 mAh and 2400 mAh. The device has a low power sensing element and an actuating mechanism. The payload most likely will be around 100 bytes. The frequency of communication will be about every two minutes during peak activity. With the advances in the IoT and market demands, this PoC has gained some attention.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am looking at the [CC3200 wireless MCU][2] from Texas Instrument as primary because it is the successor to the CC3100. With the CC3100, when not in use, power can be completely switched off. There are other vendors with integrated wifi modules. So in order to maintain the low power option and to add IoT capability, what critical parameters should I pay close attention to when selecting the components to build the next PoC?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**References:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [SimpleLink™ CC3100/CC3200 Wi-Fi Internet-on-a-chip Networking Sub-system Power Management][3]&#xD;&#xA; - [How to Select your Wi-Fi Module?][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.ti.com/product/CC3100&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.ti.com/product/CC3200&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.ti.com/lit/an/swra462/swra462.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://www.testequity.com/documents/pdf/applications/wi-fi-module-an.pdf" />

With the advances in the IoT and market demands, this PoC has gained some attention.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Per the suggestion of few IOT platform providers I am looking at [CC3200 wireless MCU][2] from Texas Instrument primarily because it is the successor to the CC3100. At a system level when not in use the CC3100 power can be completely switched off. This is a significant advantage for low power at a systems level. When activity is detected the sensing element wakes up the microcontroller via an interrupt. There are other integrated wifi MCU’s such as [ESP8266][3], [BCM43362][4], [ATWINC1500B][5], [88MC200][6] and many more. I use [ULPBench Scores][7] to do a first order analysis of low power microcontrollers followed by analysis such as described in [How to select a micro controller for a low power application?][8]  to help select a low power microcontroller. I have used parameters such as active mode current draw per frequency, and current draw a different low power modes to make an informed selection. So in order to maintain the low power option and to add IoT capability, what are critical parameters (may related to wireless communication) that I should I pay close attention to when selecting an integrated wifi MCU?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**References:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [SimpleLink™ CC3100/CC3200 Wi-Fi Internet-on-a-chip Networking Sub-system Power Management][9]&#xD;&#xA; - [How to Select your Wi-Fi Module?][10]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.ti.com/product/CC3100&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.ti.com/product/CC3200&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.cypress.com/products/ieee-80211-abgn-wlan-sdio-usb-and-mimo&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-42487-ATWINC1500B-MU_Datasheet.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://www.marvell.com/microcontrollers/88MC200/&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://www.eembc.org/ulpbench/&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://engineering.stackexchange.com/questions/1987/how-to-select-a-micro-controller-for-a-low-power-application/10606#10606&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: http://www.ti.com/lit/an/swra462/swra462.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [10]: https://www.testequity.com/documents/pdf/applications/wi-fi-module-an.pdf" />

[Reference][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Kirkland, Washington – June 16, 2016 –** The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) announced that its next release, coming late 2016 to early 2017, will be called Bluetooth 5 and will include significantly increased range, speed, and broadcast messaging capacity. Extending range will deliver robust, reliable Internet of Things (IoT) connections that make full-home and building and outdoor use cases a reality. Higher speeds will send data faster and optimize responsiveness. Increasing broadcast capacity will propel the next generation of “connectionless” services like beacons and location-relevant information and navigation. These Bluetooth advancements open up more possibilities and enable SIG companies – now at an all-time high of 30,000 member companies – to build an accessible, interoperable IoT.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As others have pointed out I trade off bandwidth, range and cost. But with this new promising Bluetooth release I will get the following advantages according to [Texas Instruments][2]. And there probably won't be a trade off at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. &gt;**Longer range** will enable point-to-point and star networks to provide reliable, whole-house coverage for smart home applications such as security systems, lighting, smoke detectors and door locks. TI’s SimpleLink ultra-low power wireless MCUs provide industry leading RF performance to enable longer range and more robust connectivity today, and will introduce up to four times longer range with Bluetooth 5. Longer range will also be a huge advantage in mesh networks, reducing the number of hops necessary to transfer packets between nodes, which in turn reduces network congestion and improves stability.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. &gt;**Higher speeds** will enable data transfer at twice the rate while improving spectral and energy efficiency and enable new higher throughput applications such as audio. Transferring large amounts of data, for instance in medical, sports and fitness applications, will also be much faster providing a better overall user experience. When combined with data length extension in Bluetooth 4.2, which is already supported on CC2640 devices, higher speeds from Bluetooth 5 will provide 500 percent increased data throughput over Bluetooth 4.0. Today, TI’s CC2640 wireless MCU supports up to 5Mbps communication.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. &gt;**Increased broadcasting capacity** will allow beacons to transmit richer and more intelligent data to enable effortless and seamless location and navigation services.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With these changes Bluetooth become a lot stronger and TI already offers a [low power wireless MCU][3] to start with. Though new smart phones and tablets should adopt to this new Bluetooth 5, but that should be only a matter of time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.bluetooth.com/news/pressreleases/2016/06/16/-bluetooth5-quadruples-rangedoubles-speedincreases-data-broadcasting-capacity-by-800&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://e2e.ti.com/blogs_/b/connecting_wirelessly/archive/2016/06/22/bluetooth-5-will-unlock-the-power-of-the-simplelink-cc2640-wireless-mcu?hootPostID=e982e464076614be2ac05b1f2b814f8e&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.ti.com/product/CC2640/datasheet" />

That makes it more suitable for microcontrollers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am not a neural network expert and it is quite complex so I can be wrong, but based on these papers I would say that Cotton, Wilamowski and Dündar's approach requires an external, more powerful platform to perform the training.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~wilambm/pap/2008/A%20Neural%20Network%20Implementation%20on%20an%20Inexpensive%20Eight%20Bit%20Microcontroller.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~wilambm/pap/2007/Neural%20Network%20Trainer%20with%20Second%20Order%20Learning%20Algorithms.PDF" />

They claim that the subscribing client may not be able to keep up with a high load of messages and propose to use a broker plugin to directly hook into the stream of messages instead. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Sometimes it is necessary to subscribe to all messages, which are transferred over the broker, for example when persisting all of them into a database. This should not be done by using a MQTT client and subscribing to the multi level wildcard. The reason is that often the subscribing client is not able to process the load of messages that is coming its way. Especially if you have a massive throughput. Our recommended solution is to implement an extension in the MQTT broker, for example the plugin system of HiveMQ allows you to hook into the behavior of HiveMQ and add a asynchronous routine to process each incoming message and persist it to a database.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is there either&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - a similar system (extension/plugin) for the mosquitto broker,&#xD;&#xA; - another recommended method that works with mosquitto, or&#xD;&#xA; - reasonable evidence that this approach is unneccesary at all, i.e. that a client subscribing to `#` can do just fine? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/q/31584613/3984613 does not address this question exhaustively.&lt;/sup&gt;" />

[Reference][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Kirkland, Washington – June 16, 2016 –** The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) announced that its next release, coming late 2016 to early 2017, will be called Bluetooth 5 and will include significantly increased range, speed, and broadcast messaging capacity. Extending range will deliver robust, reliable Internet of Things (IoT) connections that make full-home and building and outdoor use cases a reality. Higher speeds will send data faster and optimize responsiveness. Increasing broadcast capacity will propel the next generation of “connectionless” services like beacons and location-relevant information and navigation. These Bluetooth advancements open up more possibilities and enable SIG companies – now at an all-time high of 30,000 member companies – to build an accessible, interoperable IoT.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As others have pointed out I trade off bandwidth, range and cost. But with this new promising Bluetooth release I will get the following advantages according to [Texas Instruments][2]. And there probably won't be a trade off at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. &gt;**Longer range** will enable point-to-point and star networks to provide reliable, whole-house coverage for smart home applications such as security systems, lighting, smoke detectors and door locks. TI’s SimpleLink ultra-low power wireless MCUs provide industry leading RF performance to enable longer range and more robust connectivity today, and will introduce up to four times longer range with Bluetooth 5. Longer range will also be a huge advantage in mesh networks, reducing the number of hops necessary to transfer packets between nodes, which in turn reduces network congestion and improves stability.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. &gt;**Higher speeds** will enable data transfer at twice the rate while improving spectral and energy efficiency and enable new higher throughput applications such as audio. Transferring large amounts of data, for instance in medical, sports and fitness applications, will also be much faster providing a better overall user experience. When combined with data length extension in Bluetooth 4.2, which is already supported on CC2640 devices, higher speeds from Bluetooth 5 will provide 500 percent increased data throughput over Bluetooth 4.0. Today, TI’s CC2640 wireless MCU supports up to 5Mbps communication.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. &gt;**Increased broadcasting capacity** will allow beacons to transmit richer and more intelligent data to enable effortless and seamless location and navigation services.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With these changes Bluetooth become a lot stronger and TI already offers a [low power wireless MCU][3] to start with. Though new smart phones and tablets should adopt to this new Bluetooth 5, but that should be only a matter of time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Further information about Bluetooth 5 can be found [here][4].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.bluetooth.com/news/pressreleases/2016/06/16/-bluetooth5-quadruples-rangedoubles-speedincreases-data-broadcasting-capacity-by-800&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://e2e.ti.com/blogs_/b/connecting_wirelessly/archive/2016/06/22/bluetooth-5-will-unlock-the-power-of-the-simplelink-cc2640-wireless-mcu?hootPostID=e982e464076614be2ac05b1f2b814f8e&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.ti.com/product/CC2640/datasheet&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/adopted-specifications" />

Usually mesh networking is provided by level 3 or 4 or even both of the [ISO OSI model][1], depending on the extend of implementation. The network and transport layers provide the basic reliability of the mesh network. That reliability is usually not impeded when a node drops off.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;MQTT and AMQP are application layer protocols on level 7. Therefore these protocols are dependent on the reliability of the lower levels as far as the basic model goes. However it's always the prerogative of higher OSI levels to implement safeguards to cope with failures of the lower levels. For example the application can switch to a completely different network, like from Wi-Fi to 4G for example if it detects network failure. Smartphones do it all the time when we enter or leave a place with a configured Wi-Fi.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are also possibilities for the lower levels to accommodate for failures in upper levels. OSI level 4 load balancing for example can accommodate for failing nodes behind it. Of course, that requires that each nodes that can be addressed for [load balancing][3] and or failover solutions can provide the same service. Also obviously you need the *central component* at least twice. Since [MQTT][2] is basically application level routing based on topics that should be possible by simple duplication. This is [an example of an MQTT cluster solution][4] with the HiveMQ implementation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With that in mind it can be concluded that, **no**, *the reliability on the network and transport levels cannot be negated by the choice of any higher level protocols.* However that does not apply to the user experience. For the user the lower level protocols are just vehicles. Using an application layer protocol that has a single point of failure still means, that if that node is broken, then **yes**, *the functionality is broken even though my network is still working.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anyhow, the application layer and above are responsible to provide the reliability to the user. Mesh networks can only deliver the basics. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*There is one final thing to consider. Unless one has redundancies for every component, there are always use cases that have single points of failure. It's most likely the node the user actually interacts with.

I've checked compatibility for you using the [compatibility checker](https://support.myharmony.com/en-gb/compatibility) and both your devices are listed as supported, and your method of using the Pi may be similarly expensive (but will also require the trouble of designing the software and finding the IR codes):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/processor-microcontroller-development-kits/8968660/) - £32.99&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From the guide you linked, here are the other parts required:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [Adafruit Protoboard](https://octopart.com/801-adafruit+industries-24605284) - £10.13&#xD;&#xA;- [Two IR LEDs](https://octopart.com/ir333c-everlight-17677690) - £0.334 each&#xD;&#xA;- [Two LED holders](https://octopart.com/hlmp-5029-avago-549484) - £0.097 each&#xD;&#xA;- [Transistor](https://octopart.com/p2n2222ag-on+semiconductor-55396558) - £0.083&#xD;&#xA;- [10 kOhm resistor](https://octopart.com/od103je-ohmite-133027) - £0.167&#xD;&#xA;- [IR receiver](https://octopart.com/tsop38238-vishay-5517697) - £0.471&#xD;&#xA;- [Hook-up Wire Spool Set](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1311) - $15.95 = approximately £13 as of December 2016&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(full model names omitted, and prices quoted as cheapest when this post was written for 1 unit)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you total these, the price comes to approximately £57.70, which saves £41.30 compared to the Logitech Harmony Hub, but you will have to spend time designing the software to control the IR transmitter/receiver and the Alexa skill. Alternatively, if you decide to integrate it with SmartThings with the ZigBee/Z-Wave components you listed, the totals will be approximately £84 and **£114** for the whole device (the latter is **more** than the £99 Logitech Hub!).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You may be able to reduce the price significantly, though, by using a more simple microcontroller, since I doubt it will be so complex that a Raspberry Pi 3 would be required.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In summary, if you're in for a challenge and don't mind getting your hands dirty, you could save quite a lot of money by designing it yourself (as long as you avoid the **really expensive components**).

I've checked compatibility for you using the [compatibility checker](https://support.myharmony.com/en-gb/compatibility) and both your devices are listed as supported, and your method of using the Pi may be similarly expensive (but will also require the trouble of designing the software and finding the IR codes):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/processor-microcontroller-development-kits/8968660/) - £32.99&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From the guide you linked, here are the other parts required:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [Adafruit Protoboard](https://octopart.com/801-adafruit+industries-24605284) - £10.13&#xD;&#xA;- [Two IR LEDs](https://octopart.com/ir333c-everlight-17677690) - £0.334 each&#xD;&#xA;- [Two LED holders](https://octopart.com/hlmp-5029-avago-549484) - £0.097 each&#xD;&#xA;- [Transistor](https://octopart.com/p2n2222ag-on+semiconductor-55396558) - £0.083&#xD;&#xA;- [10 kOhm resistor](https://octopart.com/od103je-ohmite-133027) - £0.167&#xD;&#xA;- [IR receiver](https://octopart.com/tsop38238-vishay-5517697) - £0.471&#xD;&#xA;- [Hook-up Wire Spool Set](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1311) - $15.95 	≈ £13 as of December 2016&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(full model names omitted, and prices quoted as cheapest when this post was written for 1 unit)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you total these, the price comes to approximately £57.70, which saves £41.30 compared to the Logitech Harmony Hub, but you will have to spend time designing the software to control the IR transmitter/receiver and the Alexa skill. Alternatively, if you decide to integrate it with SmartThings with the ZigBee/Z-Wave components you listed, the totals will be approximately £84 and **£114** for the whole device (the latter is **more** than the £99 Logitech Hub!).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You may be able to reduce the price significantly, though, by using a more simple microcontroller, since I doubt it will be so complex that a Raspberry Pi 3 would be required.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In summary, if you're in for a challenge and don't mind getting your hands dirty, you could save quite a lot of money by designing it yourself (as long as you avoid the **really expensive components**). If you want convenience, Logitech's solution seems ideal since the integration with Alexa is already there and you also get control via your smartphone for free!" />

This can be very easily tested by prohibiting the device from reaching the Internet in your router. The Echo/Echo Dot will still recognize the wake word, but the light ring will go red and the device tells you it has no Internet connection. So, we can very simply verify, that ***the wake word recognition is indeed done locally***.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Only after detecting the wake word the device contacts the Alexa cloud service.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;According to Amazon, the device only streams to the cloud when the light ring is blue and it doesn't listen at all when you muted it and the light ring is beaming solid red. Of course, cautious people can verify that with network tools like Wireshark to make sure it really only transmits then.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1]:https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201602230" />

Now I am trying to understand the underlying software and hardware architecture for such an implementation. Based on simple Google searches, the following is my understanding. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The headless smart plug makes a peer to peer connection to a device such as a mobile phone or computer. Using a device with a UI, network configurations are entered into the IoT device. The IoT device then connects to the access point to make some type of authentication with a cloud service, and establishes a connection. The mobile app communicates the commands to the cloud service which then relays the command to the smart plug. This is pretty straightforward.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I like to understand a little bit deeper in both software and hardware architecture for this type of design. It is fair say that there is some type of Wi-Fi device like the [CC3100 Wi-Fi chip][2] or similar. There is some type of microcontroller like an ARM Cortex. It could be an integrated Wi-Fi controller such as a [CC3200][3].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What is the underlying software and hardware architecture to implement such a design to setup and establish a secure communication link? What type of minimum security needs to be implemented to secure the device?

By default, the wake word is Alexa.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you reread that last sentence it may not make sense, especially if you are in the security field.

Are there existing strategies when flashing microcontrollers over the air?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Aside from your code that does the updating which would be relatively static, you need to keep two images in your storage: an active image and a backup image. Whenever, you need to update, do it in the backup, then switch that to be active. Once stable, update the old active image which should now be your backup.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With that in mind, you can use wear-leveling algorithms when updating both images. The code for such algorithms might take around 10-15% of the total storage, but it's well worth it in extending the device's lifespan.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Wear leveling is typically managed by the flash controller, which uses a wear leveling algorithm to determine which physical block to use each time data is programmed. There are two types of solid-state drive (SSD) wear leveling: dynamic and static. Dynamic wear leveling pools erased blocks and selects the block with the lowest erase count for the next write.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Static wear leveling, on the other hand, selects the target block with&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the lowest overall erase count, erases the block if necessary, writes&#xD;&#xA;&gt; new data to the block, and ensures that blocks of static data are&#xD;&#xA;&gt; moved when their block erase count is below a certain threshold. This&#xD;&#xA;&gt; additional step of moving data can slow write performance due to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; overhead on the flash controller, but static wear leveling is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; considerably more effective than dynamic wear leveling for extending&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the lifespan of solid state devices.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;([Techtarget.com: Wear leveling][1])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://searchsolidstatestorage.techtarget.com/definition/wear-leveling" />

Wi-Fi HaLow’s range is nearly twice that of today’s Wi-Fi, and will not only be capable of transmitting signals further, but also providing a more robust connection in challenging environments where the ability to more easily penetrate walls or other barriers is an important consideration.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, as mentioned in the linked source, HaLow operates in the 900MHz frequency, which, according to [eWeek](http://www.eweek.com/networking/halow-wifi-standard-brings-its-own-set-of-highs-and-lows-2.html), is an unlicensed frequency:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Unfortunately, the new HaLow standard doesn't have its frequencies to itself. Because the 900MHz band is shared with other licensed services, the new WiFi band is subject to interference from other users and there is no remedy when that interference happens.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For example, if a ham radio operator next door goes on the air with a powerful signal that wipes out your smart thermostat, you're out of luck. Because you're an unlicensed service, you're required to accept that interference.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; However, if your smart thermostat happens to cause interference to that ham radio operator next door, then you're required to stop doing it. As an unlicensed user, you have few rights to the spectrum if someone else wants to use it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Presumably this is related to the [FCC rules](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b9648f6ec90b7ebfad611bf26c88c34&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt47.1.15&amp;rgn=div5#se47.1.15_119) which are commonly seen on RF products:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This device complies with part 15 of the FCC Rules. Operation is subject to the following two conditions: (1) This device may not cause harmful interference, and (2) this device must accept any interference received, including interference that may cause undesired operation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Does this make HaLow too problematic for use as a communication method, since my transmissions could easily be forced to stop if someone else was transmitting in that frequency? If I wished to design a device using HaLow, how could I avoid interference which would require me to stop broadcasting?" />

And there is: HaLow isn't going to be as good at quickly transferring data. **This isn't Wi-Fi for browsing the web; it's for transferring small bits of data on infrequent occasions**. Device manufacturers can, to some extent, customize HaLow to their needs to get faster transfers, but that'll happen at the expense of battery life.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So as WiFi HaLow is designed for lower bandwidth and for battry saving low-power applications it might a be better solution if we are already talking about interference.

Alas, that's not your goal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I checked the usual suspects, but IFTTT does not offer the *that-branch* for Alexa. It also seems to be incapable of just playing your voice back and thus making the voice output of the one Alexa the input of the other one. However that would mean a delay for a timer, since timers are relative times. Moreover, this would only work with different wake words, since otherwise the Echos don't react both (cf.

That also eliminates the possibility to just speak somewhere where all Echos can hear you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;If you have more than one device using the same wake word, ***Alexa responds intelligently from the Echo you're closest to with ESP (Echo Spatial Perception)***, and performs the requested task.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;([Amazon Documentation][3], emphasis mine)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The page also confirms that the alarms are device specific.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Some content is not common between devices on the same account, including:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;- Alarms and timers&#xD;&#xA;&gt;- Sounds&#xD;&#xA;&gt;- Bluetooth connections&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The following solidifies even more that there is no off-the-shelf solution for the dual alarms.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;**Note:** You cannot connect multiple Alexa devices to each other and play the same requested audio at the same time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course you can use the app to set the alarm from wherever you are and can set it for each Echo.

Basically, it remembers the state of the devices and uses infrared signals to fake the remotes and change to the configured settings when I activate a setup like *Watch Fire TV* or *Watch Blu-Ray*. Those two require different input settings for the TV (Toshiba 42SL863G).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, my second home automation stage is screwing things up a bit. As it turns out my TV defaults to a different base setting when it is shut off compared to losing mains power. Since I want to shut down the whole media circus via smart plug I have two starting points.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1.

Z-Wave operates within the 915 MHz ISM band.  This gives it reasonable penetration of building materials (better than WiFi) and good overall distance.  The fact that few other household devices use that band (now that 900 MHz cordless phones are less widespread) means there's also less interference.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ZigBee can operate at either 2.4 GHz or 915 MHz.  2.4 GHz is a busy band; it's where WiFi and microwave ovens (among other things) operate.  That means that 2.4 GHz ZigBee devices are subject to more interference than 915 MHz Z-Wave and ZigBee devices.  They also don't go through walls as readily.  (The 2.4 GHz band does give higher bitrates, which is why WiFi lives there (and also uses the 5 GHz band), but most IoT devices don't need to transfer lots of data quickly, so the lower bandwidth of the 915 MHz band isn't a drawback.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Openness&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ZigBee is an open standard, though you need to join the ZigBee alliance (for a fee) if you want to sell ZigBee devices.  Z-Wave is a licensed proprietary standard, although the high-level protocol is documented publicly.  If you want to make Z-Wave hardware, you have to license the specification from the Z-Wave Alliance and then have your device tested for compliance to the standard.  If you buy a Z-Wave device with an appropriately-programmable interface, you can use the already-licensed hardware with the public protocol specification to write your own software.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Price&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because of the lower barrier to entry, ZigBee devices can often be less expensive than Z-Wave devices with the same functionality.  Consumer IoT hardware can vary widely in price for many other reasons, of course.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Interoperability&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Z-Wave devices tend to have better interoperability overall.  When new versions of the Z-Wave standard have been released, they've maintained backward compatibility; any Z-Wave device should be able to communicate sensibly with any other Z-Wave device, regardless of the age or manufacturer of each.  (Obviously, newer protocol features won't be present, but the older functionality will be preserved.)  Interoperability testing is part of the Z-Wave compliance process.  ZigBee doesn't have as rigorous a testing regimen, so it sometimes happens that two ZigBee devices that should be able to talk to each other cannot, due to implementation flaws in one or both devices.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On top of that, ZigBee supports a number of different *profiles* which all share the same underlying protocol but use different communication details.  (This is somewhat analogous to two different HTTP APIs; both use HTTP as a transport, but the Google Maps API isn't going to be very useful if you're talking to GitHub's servers.)  *Most* IoT ZigBee devices use the Home Automation profile, but that's not typically documented on the device, so you can run into unexpected problems.  As an example, Philips Hue lights use ZigBee, but do so in a deliberately inoperable way so you have to use the Philips Hue Bridge to control them.  (Contrast that with Z-Wave: the Z-Wave certification process requires that any Z-Wave light bulbs use the standard control classes and, thus, can be managed by any compliant Z-Wave controller.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Non-Differences&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As long as I've written the above, I figured I'd mention a few things that ZigBee and Z-Wave have in common that differentiate them from other protocols used for IoT devices.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ZigBee and Z-Wave are both mesh networks.  Unlike WiFi and Bluetooth, where every device needs to see the controller, Z* devices are okay as long as there's some communication path between them, other Z* devices in the same network, and the controller.  (Z-Wave devices will only mesh with Z-Wave devices, and ZigBee devices with a particular profile will only mesh with other ZigBee devices with that profile, of course.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ZigBee and Z-Wave are both multi-vendor protocols.  Notwithstanding the stuff in the &quot;Openness&quot; section above, both ZigBee and Z-Wave have devices available from a variety of companies who often compete with each other.  (e.g. companies making Z-Wave light switches include GE, Aeotec, Linear, DragonTech, and others.)  Many other IoT-related protocols are single-company silos (e.g. Lutron Caséta); while they might have gateways that let other systems control them, only that company's devices can join the network." />

Take, for example, a [mesh network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking) (the topology used by ZigBee, Z-Wave and Thread), which tends to be structured like so:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Mesh network](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/NetworkTopology-Mesh.svg/592px-NetworkTopology-Mesh.svg.png)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(image from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking#/media/File:NetworkTopology-Mesh.svg), in the public domain)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nodes in the network must be capable of sending messages for themselves, but they must also be able to **route messages across the network**, which is more more complex, since each node must be able to calculate a route to the destination. The [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/64/slides/6lowpan-3.pdf) has a rather interesting presentation on the routing protocols used in [6LoWPAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6LoWPAN), a mesh network protocol that uses IPv6. As you can see, the design is far more involved than a traditional star network connected to a Wi-Fi router, and of course each node will need more computational power to handle the additional processing steps needed to participate in the mesh network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The main problem of all of this is that each node will require more processing power, and hence cost more. A [TechTarget article](http://searchitchannel.techtarget.com/tip/Introduction-to-network-centralization-and-decentralization) addresses this more generally:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Centralization is an attempt to improve efficiency by taking advantage of potential economies of scale: improving the average; it may also improve reliability by minimizing opportunities for error. Decentralization is an attempt to improve speed and flexibility by reorganizing to increase local control and execution of a service: improving the best case. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other side effect will be that the increased computation will lead to a higher power consumption (although this tradeoff may not be *that* significant compared to long-range transmissions which would otherwise be necessary).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Security&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unless security is built-in to the design of the decentralised protocol, it can easily pose a big problem. Since nodes will be passing data between each other, it's difficult to guarantee the integrity of each packet, since one router node could easily replace one packet with another, and the receiver would never be able to tell the difference. A [Chron article](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/security-issues-wireless-mesh-networks-46553.html) describes this issue well:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; If a computer becomes infected or malicious computer enters a mesh network, it can pretend to be a trusted member of that network and then modify sent data and disrupt how the network passes information. In a black hole attack, information passing through the infected computer will not continue through the network, blocking the flow of data. In gray hole attacks, some data may be blocked, while other data is allowed, making it seem like the computer is still a working part of the network. Wormhole attacks are harder to detect: They tunnel into a network computer from the outside and pretend to be other nodes in the network, essentially becoming invisible nodes. They can then monitor network traffic as it passes from one node to the next.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Economies of Scale&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Large cloud platforms such as [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/?nc2=h_lg) or [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/) allow you to set up a centralised server for a price that is *dirt cheap* - Amazon and Microsoft have the benefit of running truly immense server farms which allows them to provide server space for a very low price. Have a play with the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/pricing/calculator/) to see what I mean - you can run a function 1 million times in a month, using 128MB of RAM and taking 5 seconds per execution for £2.20/month, and scaling up the capacity is trivially easy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, scaling up a decentralised network requires adding more and more nodes, and I expect that you would start to see *diseconomies of scale*, since the nodes would need to spend more and more time routing data rather than performing useful computation." />

Z-Wave operates within the 915 MHz ISM band.  This gives it reasonable penetration of building materials (better than Wi-Fi) and good overall distance.  The fact that few other household devices use that band (now that 900 MHz cordless phones are less widespread) means there's also less interference.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ZigBee can operate at either 2.4 GHz or 915 MHz.  2.4 GHz is a busy band; it's where Wi-Fi and microwave ovens (among other things) operate.  That means that 2.4 GHz ZigBee devices are subject to more interference than 915 MHz Z-Wave and ZigBee devices.  They also don't go through walls as readily.  (The 2.4 GHz band does give higher bit rates, which is why WiFi lives there (and also uses the 5 GHz band), but most IoT devices don't need to transfer lots of data quickly, so the lower bandwidth of the 915 MHz band isn't a drawback.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Openness&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ZigBee is an open standard, though you need to join the ZigBee alliance (for a fee), if you want to sell ZigBee devices.  Z-Wave is a licensed proprietary standard, although the high-level protocol is documented publicly.  If you want to make Z-Wave hardware, you have to license the specification from the Z-Wave Alliance and then have your device tested for compliance to the standard.  If you buy a Z-Wave device with an appropriately-programmable interface, you can use the already-licensed hardware with the public protocol specification to write your own software.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Price&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because of the lower barrier to entry, ZigBee devices can often be less expensive than Z-Wave devices with the same functionality.  Consumer IoT hardware can vary widely in price for many other reasons, of course.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Interoperability&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Z-Wave devices tend to have better interoperability overall.  When new versions of the Z-Wave standard have been released, they've maintained backward compatibility; any Z-Wave device should be able to communicate sensibly with any other Z-Wave device, regardless of the age or manufacturer of each.  (Obviously, newer protocol features won't be present, but the older functionality will be preserved.)  Interoperability testing is part of the Z-Wave compliance process.  ZigBee doesn't have as rigorous a testing regimen, so it sometimes happens that two ZigBee devices that should be able to talk to each other cannot, due to implementation flaws in one or both devices.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On top of that, ZigBee supports a number of different *profiles* which all share the same underlying protocol but use different communication details.  (This is somewhat analogous to two different HTTP APIs; both use HTTP as a transport, but the Google Maps API isn't going to be very useful if you're talking to GitHub's servers.)  *Most* IoT ZigBee devices use the Home Automation profile, but that's not typically documented on the device, so you can run into unexpected problems.  As an example, Philips Hue lights use ZigBee, but do so in a deliberately inoperable way so you have to use the Philips Hue Bridge to control them.  (Contrast that with Z-Wave: the Z-Wave certification process requires that any Z-Wave light bulbs use the standard control classes and, thus, can be managed by any compliant Z-Wave controller.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Similarities&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As long as I've written the above, I figured I'd mention a few things that ZigBee and Z-Wave have in common that differentiate them from other protocols used for IoT devices.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ZigBee and Z-Wave are both mesh networks.  Unlike WiFi and Bluetooth, where every device needs to see the controller, Z* devices are okay as long as there's some communication path between them, other Z* devices in the same network, and the controller.  (Z-Wave devices will only mesh with Z-Wave devices, and ZigBee devices with a particular profile will only mesh with other ZigBee devices with that profile, of course.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ZigBee and Z-Wave are both multi-vendor protocols.  Notwithstanding the stuff in the &quot;Openness&quot; section above, both ZigBee and Z-Wave have devices available from a variety of companies who often compete with each other.  (e.g. companies making Z-Wave light switches include GE, Aeotec, Linear, DragonTech, and others.)  Many other IoT-related protocols are single-company silos (e.g. Lutron Caséta); while they might have gateways that let other systems control them, only that company's devices can join the network." />

In my professional life, I can leave decisions about hardware, which , if it is off-the-shelf, tends to dictate the choice of the Layer 2 protocol, to the hardware guys. In my private life, I choose by price, support (size of community &amp; availability of forums is **very** important) and a best guess understanding of the spec&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I tend to look for the functionality of the overall system. For instance, for [mesh networks][2], there are some excellent ZigBee solutions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For example, do some signals work better long-range and some better in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;noisy&quot; environments?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For long-range, I cannot recommend highly enough [Flutter][3] with a 1km/half mile range, as opposed to 100m.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It costs only US $20, and here is a picture to give you some idea of the range &#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][4]][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Noisy environments is not my speciality—I leave that to the hardware guys, sorry—but you might want to look into things like the [Shannon limit][5], which is a software, as opposed to hardware, approach to noise (also, [Forward Error Correction][6], etc)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I said, those protocols are &quot;low level&quot; stuff to me, as an application developer (layer 3 guy, actually, which is a little lower).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yes, it is important that you consider that sort of thing, but many will just say &quot;I know, I will go with Raspberry PI (or whatever)&quot; and accept whatever it offers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After that, when developing your application, you need to decide which higher level protocol to use. Generally, unless your server dictates a particular protocol, you have three main choices:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Use TCP, and develop a proprietary protocol.&#xD;&#xA;- Use HTTP(S) and develop a [RESTful][7] interface (go [AJAX][8] if you want asynchronous, non-blocking, for instance if you multi-thread). Unless you have many transactions, are time critical, or your server operations will take a long time, you can get away with a blocking interface. &#xD;&#xA;- Choose one of the plethora of IoT &quot;standards&quot;. I would only advise this if your device provides strong support for one particular protocol, or your server demands it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope that I understood your question correctly. Perhaps you can tell us whether you are more hardware or software oriented, and whether you will be developing only for the IoT device, or also for the server, or maybe this is just a general question (which is not encouraged)?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flutterwireless/flutter-20-wireless-arduino-with-half-mile-1km-ran&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/bq3gC.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy-channel_coding_theorem&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_error_correction&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)" />

Take, for example, a [mesh network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking) (the topology used by ZigBee, Z-Wave and Thread), which tends to be structured like so:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Mesh network](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/NetworkTopology-Mesh.svg/592px-NetworkTopology-Mesh.svg.png)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(image from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking#/media/File:NetworkTopology-Mesh.svg), in the public domain)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nodes in the network must be capable of sending messages for themselves, but they must also be able to **route messages across the network**, which is more more complex, since each node must be able to calculate a route to the destination. The [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/64/slides/6lowpan-3.pdf) has a rather interesting presentation on the routing protocols used in [6LoWPAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6LoWPAN), a mesh network protocol that uses IPv6. As you can see, the design is far more involved than a traditional star network connected to a Wi-Fi router, and of course each node will need more computational power to handle the additional processing steps needed to participate in the mesh network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The main problem of all of this is that each node will require more processing power, and hence cost more. A [TechTarget article](http://searchitchannel.techtarget.com/tip/Introduction-to-network-centralization-and-decentralization) addresses this more generally:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Centralization is an attempt to improve efficiency by taking advantage of potential economies of scale: improving the average; it may also improve reliability by minimizing opportunities for error. Decentralization is an attempt to improve speed and flexibility by reorganizing to increase local control and execution of a service: improving the best case. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other side effect will be that the increased computation will lead to a higher power consumption (although this tradeoff may not be *that* significant compared to long-range transmissions which would otherwise be necessary).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Security&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unless security is built-in to the design of the decentralised protocol, it can easily pose a big problem. Since nodes will be passing data between each other, it's difficult to guarantee the integrity of each packet, since one router node could easily replace one packet with another, and the receiver would never be able to tell the difference. A [Chron article](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/security-issues-wireless-mesh-networks-46553.html) describes this issue well:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; If a computer becomes infected or malicious computer enters a mesh network, it can pretend to be a trusted member of that network and then modify sent data and disrupt how the network passes information. In a black hole attack, information passing through the infected computer will not continue through the network, blocking the flow of data. In gray hole attacks, some data may be blocked, while other data is allowed, making it seem like the computer is still a working part of the network. Wormhole attacks are harder to detect: They tunnel into a network computer from the outside and pretend to be other nodes in the network, essentially becoming invisible nodes. They can then monitor network traffic as it passes from one node to the next.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Economies of Scale&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Large cloud platforms such as [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/?nc2=h_lg) or [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/) allow you to set up a centralised server for a price that is *dirt cheap* - Amazon and Microsoft have the benefit of running truly immense server farms which allows them to provide server space for a very low price. Have a play with the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/pricing/calculator/) to see what I mean - you can run a function 1 million times in a month, using 128MB of RAM and taking 5 seconds per execution for £2.20/month, and scaling up the capacity is trivially easy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, scaling up a decentralised network requires adding more and more nodes, and I expect that you would start to see *diseconomies of scale*, since the nodes would need to spend more and more time routing data rather than performing useful computation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In summary, although decentralised networks looks like a perfect solution, they **do** have significant disadvantages, which is why many IoT developers still favour centralised solutions." />

It's data rate and the resulting application throughput of 20 to 60 kBit/s is significantly reduced compared to its competitors, i.e.  Bluetooth and ZigBee. For applications that get along with that restriction and a physical range that is comparable to other wireless network systems it might well be an interesting alternative. It would seem that it is primarily used by sports and fitness sensors by a number of manufacturers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This [Wikipedia page](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANT_(Netzwerk)) states that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Geräte benötigen beim Empfang oder Senden weniger als 50 mW Leistung. Da sie die meiste Zeit im Sleep-Mode verharren, ist die Gesamtstromaufnahme gering.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Which roughly translates to:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Devices require less than 50 mW of power when receiving or transmitting. Since they remain in sleep mode for most of the time, the total current consumption is low.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It focuses on ANT being specifically well suited for low power sensor networks with less than 50 mW of power consumption during transmissions and being in sleep mode most of the time. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, one would expect any battery powered appliance (and even more so devices powered by energy harvesting) making heavy use of deep sleep modes during times of inactivity. I wonder how a &quot;real life&quot; sensor network using ANT would compete against other technologies such as Bluetooth low energy in terms of power consumption?" />

Text="There are a few things that really distinguish Z-Wave and ZigBee from each other.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Frequency&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first (as Eirik M noted) is the frequency on which they operate.  Z-Wave operates within the 915 MHz ISM band.  This gives it reasonable penetration of building materials (better than Wi-Fi) and good overall distance.  The fact that few other household devices use that band (now that 900 MHz cordless phones are less widespread) means there's also less interference.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ZigBee can operate at either 2.4 GHz or 915 MHz.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;  2.4 GHz is a busy band; it's where Wi-Fi and microwave ovens (among other things) operate.  That means that 2.4 GHz ZigBee devices are subject to more interference than 915 MHz Z-Wave and ZigBee devices.  They also don't go through walls as readily.  (The 2.4 GHz band does give higher bit rates, which is why WiFi lives there (and also uses the 5 GHz band), but most IoT devices don't need to transfer lots of data quickly, so the lower bandwidth of the 915 MHz band isn't a drawback.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 915 MHz is only used in North America.  Although 2.4 GHz is available worldwide, ZigBee's lower frequency band varies from one regulatory region to another.  The various bands are mostly in the 700 MHz to 900 MHz range, so the statements about the 915 MHz North American band are generally applicable to other regions, too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Openness&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ZigBee is an open standard, though you need to join the ZigBee alliance (for a fee), if you want to sell ZigBee devices.  Z-Wave is a licensed proprietary standard, although the high-level protocol is documented publicly.  If you want to make Z-Wave hardware, you have to license the specification from the Z-Wave Alliance and then have your device tested for compliance to the standard.  If you buy a Z-Wave device with an appropriately-programmable interface, you can use the already-licensed hardware with the public protocol specification to write your own software.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Price&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because of the lower barrier to entry, ZigBee devices can often be less expensive than Z-Wave devices with the same functionality.  Consumer IoT hardware can vary widely in price for many other reasons, of course.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Interoperability&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Z-Wave devices tend to have better interoperability overall.  When new versions of the Z-Wave standard have been released, they've maintained backward compatibility; any Z-Wave device should be able to communicate sensibly with any other Z-Wave device, regardless of the age or manufacturer of each.  (Obviously, newer protocol features won't be present, but the older functionality will be preserved.)  Interoperability testing is part of the Z-Wave compliance process.  ZigBee doesn't have as rigorous a testing regimen, so it sometimes happens that two ZigBee devices that should be able to talk to each other cannot, due to implementation flaws in one or both devices.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On top of that, ZigBee supports a number of different *profiles* which all share the same underlying protocol but use different communication details.  (This is somewhat analogous to two different HTTP APIs; both use HTTP as a transport, but the Google Maps API isn't going to be very useful if you're talking to GitHub's servers.)  *Most* IoT ZigBee devices use the Home Automation profile, but that's not typically documented on the device, so you can run into unexpected problems.  As an example, Philips Hue lights use ZigBee, but do so in a deliberately inoperable way so you have to use the Philips Hue Bridge to control them.  (Contrast that with Z-Wave: the Z-Wave certification process requires that any Z-Wave light bulbs use the standard control classes and, thus, can be managed by any compliant Z-Wave controller.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Similarities&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As long as I've written the above, I figured I'd mention a few things that ZigBee and Z-Wave have in common that differentiate them from other protocols used for IoT devices.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ZigBee and Z-Wave are both mesh networks.  Unlike WiFi and Bluetooth, where every device needs to see the controller, Z* devices are okay as long as there's some communication path between them, other Z* devices in the same network, and the controller.  (Z-Wave devices will only mesh with Z-Wave devices, and ZigBee devices with a particular profile will only mesh with other ZigBee devices with that profile, of course.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ZigBee and Z-Wave are both multi-vendor protocols.  Notwithstanding the stuff in the &quot;Openness&quot; section above, both ZigBee and Z-Wave have devices available from a variety of companies who often compete with each other.  (e.g. companies making Z-Wave light switches include GE, Aeotec, Linear, DragonTech, and others.)  Many other IoT-related protocols are single-company silos (e.g. Lutron Caséta); while they might have gateways that let other systems control them, only that company's devices can join the network." />

(This is somewhat analogous to two different HTTP APIs; both use HTTP as a transport, but the Google Maps API isn't going to be very useful if you're talking to GitHub's servers.)  *Most* IoT ZigBee devices use the Home Automation profile, but that's not typically documented on the device, so you can run into unexpected problems.  As an example, Philips Hue lights use ZigBee, but do so in a deliberately inoperable way so you have to use the Philips Hue Bridge to control them.  (Contrast that with Z-Wave: the Z-Wave certification process requires that any Z-Wave light bulbs use the standard control classes and, thus, can be managed by any compliant Z-Wave controller.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The ZigBee Alliance is currently in the process of developing a new iteration of the ZigBee protocol named ZigBee 3.0.  It looks like part of the new specification's goal will be to increase interoperability among ZigBee devices.  We'll have to see how that goes, though.  There doesn't seem to e a timetable for finalization of the new standard yet, though.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Similarities&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As long as I've written the above, I figured I'd mention a few things that ZigBee and Z-Wave have in common that differentiate them from other protocols used for IoT devices.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ZigBee and Z-Wave are both mesh networks.  Unlike WiFi and Bluetooth, where every device needs to see the controller, Z* devices are okay as long as there's some communication path between them, other Z* devices in the same network, and the controller.  (Z-Wave devices will only mesh with Z-Wave devices, and ZigBee devices with a particular profile will only mesh with other ZigBee devices with that profile, of course.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ZigBee and Z-Wave are both multi-vendor protocols.  Notwithstanding the stuff in the &quot;Openness&quot; section above, both ZigBee and Z-Wave have devices available from a variety of companies who often compete with each other.  (e.g. companies making Z-Wave light switches include GE, Aeotec, Linear, DragonTech, and others.)  Many other IoT-related protocols are single-company silos (e.g. Lutron Caséta); while they might have gateways that let other systems control them, only that company's devices can join the network." />

Since IoE is used almost exclusively by Cisco, their definition should be quite reliable:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Internet of Everything (IoE) brings together people, process, data, and things to make networked connections more relevant and valuable than ever before-turning information into actions that create new capabilities, richer experiences, and unprecedented economic opportunity for businesses, individuals, and countries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In practical terms, this boils down to a few key points, which I'll outline below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Machine to Machine (M2M) vs Machine to People (M2P)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Internet of Things is primarily associated with connecting **machines** and **devices** together so they can share data, e.g. connecting your light bulb to your smartphone so you can control it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Internet of **Everything** is a more holistic term that considers every step of the process: human interaction with the computer; the machine to machine interaction; the output to the human and the process in general.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;IoE can be used in industry to describe the changes that come about as a consequence of interconnected devices, and talk about the new processes that factories can use to be more efficient.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## The Scale of the Internet of Everything&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The IoE can also encompass systems bigger than you traditionally find in IoT networks. One example on the Cisco website is a train network, which is far bigger than you'd find in a domestic IoT network (the train could have a whole IoT network of its own, then be connected to a **bigger** network!).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Overall, there isn't a lot of difference - it's just a marketing buzzword used by Cisco, but it's otherwise very similar to the term *Internet of Things*." />

They claim that the subscribing client may not be able to keep up with a high load of messages and propose to use a broker plugin to directly hook into the stream of messages instead. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Sometimes it is necessary to subscribe to all messages, which are transferred over the broker, for example when persisting all of them into a database. This should not be done by using a MQTT client and subscribing to the multi level wildcard. The reason is that often the subscribing client is not able to process the load of messages that is coming its way. Especially if you have a massive throughput. Our recommended solution is to implement an extension in the MQTT broker, for example the plugin system of HiveMQ allows you to hook into the behavior of HiveMQ and add a asynchronous routine to process each incoming message and persist it to a database.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is there either&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - a similar system (extension/plugin) for the mosquitto broker,&#xD;&#xA; - another recommended method that works with mosquitto, or&#xD;&#xA; - reasonable evidence that this approach is unnecessary at all, i.e. that a client subscribing to `#` can do just fine? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/q/31584613/3984613 does not address this question exhaustively.&lt;/sup&gt;" />

We can see on the Google channel that they have basically four different *this* blocks, *&quot;simple phrase&quot;, &quot;with number&quot;, &quot;with text&quot; and &quot;with both&quot;*.

The primary reason is that biometric attributes are not secrets.  Some are easily duplicated, like [fingerprints][1], or [images of faces][2].  Some are harder to spoof, like [irises][3].  But once a biometric attribute is captured, it can be replayed. And biometric attributes are fixed.  If a user's attribute is ever copied, you obviously can't tell the user &quot;we've had a breach, change your iris.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is highly unlikely that an average thief will be able to spoof all of the biometric sensors simultaneously.  However, it would not be impossible for a dedicated, sophisticated attacker to engineer such a feat.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition to sensor spoofing, it may be possible to perform a replay attack using the data emitted by the sensors.  However, this would be implementation dependent, and one would expect a company to architect the security of their devices against this type of attack.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is where the IoT approach might provide worse security than an integrated solution.  If the sensors are unrelated to each other, an attacker could compromise one device at a time without raising suspicion.  The attacker can practice with a fake gummi-bear fingerprint until he gets that perfected, then he use that fake fingerprint while he practices with a photo to fool the image sensor.  An integrated sensor could be architected to require all attributes to be present at the same time; the IoT approach could be implemented in a piecemeal fashion, with vulnerabilities created by the gaps between the systems.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Practically, this approach still sounds very secure, and would be better security than a simple passcode or a single biometric measurement.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://cryptome.info/0001/gummy/gummy.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://biometrics.cse.msu.edu/Publications/Face/WenHanJain_FaceSpoofDetection_TIFS15.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/07/red-flag-biometrics-iris-scanner-vulnerability-revealed" />

What is described as *arbitrary prefixes* in the abstract is essentially a bunch of information that is assumed to be in a certain range or having a specific value. Thus, making transmitting those information unnecessary.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;To enable effective compression LOWPAN_IPHC relies on information pertaining to the entire 6LoWPAN.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This assumption goes for the *entire 6LoWPAN*, breaking down the next sentence we have six information that are assumed to be known or in a considerably smaller range of values. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;- Version is 6; &#xD;&#xA;- Traffic Class and Flow Label are both zero; &#xD;&#xA;- Payload Length can be inferred from lower layers from either&#xD;&#xA;   the 6LoWPAN Fragmentation header or the IEEE 802.15.4 header; &#xD;&#xA;- Hop Limit will be set to a well-known value by the source; &#xD;&#xA;- addresses assigned to 6LoWPAN interfaces will be formed using the link-local&#xD;&#xA;   prefix or a small set of routable prefixes assigned to the entire&#xD;&#xA;   6LoWPAN; &#xD;&#xA;- addresses assigned to 6LoWPAN interfaces are formed with an&#xD;&#xA;   IID derived directly from either the 64-bit extended or 16-bit short&#xD;&#xA;   IEEE 802.15.4 addresses.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Bullet points by me, otherwise continuing section three of the draft.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This also explains why this compression is not used by devices like your PC. Your PC has to be able to address the whole world basically. However the compression as described above is only really effective if used in a sufficiently constrained environment—the *entire 6LoWPAN*—and not the world.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;In the best case, the LOWPAN_IPHC can compress the IPv6 header down to two octets (the dispatch octet and the LOWPAN_IPHC encoding) with link-local communication.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Still same draft section)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As described in the RFC draft the compression gets even better when it's in a more constricted environment. For [link local][2] only it's down to two octets. Of course, we want our usual computers and end devices to be able to address everything else instead. However, if we want to be able to change all those values this compression takes as granted it doesn't work anymore. We'd have a mismatch between what we mean and what every other network participant thinks we mean, because the compression takes values for granted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Thus, the compression severely limits the vast possibilities of IPv6 to reach smaller headers and gain efficiency in time and energy **in a very well defined small environment.***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1]:https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6lowpan-hc-15#section-3&#xD;&#xA;[2]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-local_address" />

Open the Alexa app.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2. Open the left navigation panel and then select Settings.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 3. Select your device from the menu.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 4. Scroll down and select Wake Word.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 5. Use the drop-down menu to select a wake word and then select Save. When you change the wake word, the light ring on your device flashes orange briefly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is supported for any Alexa device activated by the wake word, and can be highly useful in situations where you are in range of multiple Echos. For example, if your kitchen and bedroom are close, your bedroom Echo might be activated when you intended to activate your kitchen device. By changing the wake word for one of these devices, you can avoid this problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, as I implied at the start of my answer, you can't choose *any wake word you like*; an [article by The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/10/05/google_why_cant_we_choose_wake_words/) suggests why:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And here's where you get to the nuts and bolts of it: choosing a wake word is a little bit of an art: it needs to be short, but a minimum of three syllables; it needs to be easy to say; it needs to have a fairly consistent pronunciation across all different types of people; and it needs to be uncommonly used.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; You need at least three syllables so the software can catch on that you're explicitly speaking to it and that it's not just picking up the start of an unrelated word or random noise. Imagine if you made the wake-up word &quot;Tom&quot; and said &quot;tomato&quot; next to your gadget – you may confuse the heck out of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Giving consumers the ability to choose their own wake words is a potentially huge headache. Companies would have to effectively guide the choice of a wake word, in a similar way to how we are now constantly told the parameters of the password we must choose: no fewer than six characters; must include a number; can't include the following characters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hence, you get *some customisation* from Alexa, but you are (wisely) not allowed to choose any wake word, because it's likely to lead to poorer voice recognition and a worse experience overall." />

The first Router Eligible node to form the network will be autonomously designated a router as well as the Leader. A Leader performs additional network management tasks and makes decisions on behalf of the network.

Also the LPG cylinder tends to be placed close to the stove. So if you can monitor use of the stove in relationship to LPG cylinder pressure, it might be possible to monitor and notify if there is a LP gas leak using something like IFTTT. Example if stove not in use and LP Gas pressure is dropping then there might be a leak and alert interested parties. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Deviating outside the scope of the question, additional services can be created  to notify users when LP gas is running low or even monitor usage patterns to help manage LP Gas usage. It is common in under develop countries to carry a secondary small backup gas cylinders to supplement until a availability of a refill. Providing a monitoring capabilities can help eliminate the secondary LP gas cylinder. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**References:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [Corrosion][1]&#xD;&#xA; - [IFTTT][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.nde-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/Materials/Physical_Chemical/Corrosion.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://ifttt.com/" />

This [reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/390u8h/parental_controls/) seems to suggest that there is no method of parental controls whatsoever:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [Are there any sort of parental controls available for the Echo?] Nope. They said that something about a family mode coming in the future that would also allow us to take it further the other way - unbleeped cussing. I'm bothered my phone Siri and Google Now can cuss and my home A.I. can't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I suggest asking them for this through feedback - maybe suggesting they allow us to customize it so it either bleeps swears AND limits explicit content or is a free-for-all so families and single adults can have different settings...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, there are some ways you can protect children, depending on your cause of concern.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Profanity&#xD;&#xA;A [GeekWire article](http://www.geekwire.com/2015/bleeping-awesome-amazon-echos-alexa-will-now-cuss-command/) discusses how Alexa will self-censor any swearing, especially in titles of music, videos and other media:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Yes, Alexa actually will bleep out part of a word that she is too modest to repeat. That may be the first mark of true artificial intelligence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Alexa will even [refuse to repeat swearing if you use the 'Simon says' command](https://www.cnet.com/uk/how-to/things-alexa-cant-do-yet/):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you use the &quot;Simon says&quot; command, Alexa will repeat anything you say. Even if you speak a number of expletives, Alexa will repeat your words, only the swearing will be bleeped out. Some people might wish she did otherwise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Unwanted Purchases&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since your Echo will be linked to an Amazon account, you may wish to [disable voice purchasing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201952610) to avoid children from unexpectedly buying things and leaving you a hefty bill to pay. Through the Alexa app, you can disable voice purchasing trivially easily.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Manners&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This may seem a rather odd point, but [some people object to the fact that Alexa will not encourage you to say 'please' and 'thank you'](http://qz.com/701521/parents-are-worried-the-amazon-echo-is-conditioning-their-kids-to-be-rude/). It seems rather unusual to worry about this in my opinion, but some people are concerned that since Alexa will respond even if you rudely command it, young children will start to believe that it is acceptable to just order people around.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is no software solution to this - you will simply have to encourage your children to *be nice*!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Overall, although there aren't any built-in parental controls, you should be relatively safe to use it around your children, provided that you take the precautions before letting your children use the device.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Can a skill set be developed/made available to implement Parental Control?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not without great difficulty. Expanding on my comment, you wouldn't be able to set any restrictions through a skill, because custom skills seem to be self-contained and can only respond when they are invoked. Unless you wanted to write a new, parental control-supporting skill for every feature you need, I don't think it's possible to create parental controls through an Alexa skill." />

So, in the Alexa model, audio _could_ be streamed continuously to a server in the cloud, or _all_ of the audio processing (not just the hot-word detection) can be performed at the node.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The important distinction of a fog node seems to be that the upstream bandwidth is reduced compared with the local bandwidth, so it is likely that audio or image processing is being performed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Based on this definition, I think even an intelligent protocol bridge is not quite a fog-node (but the hardware which is used may well be capable of performing fog-node functions) - thinking of my lightwave-rf WiFi link...&#xD;&#xA;" />

So yes, a home hub could be a fog node, but only if it supports the fog behaviors and messages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Think of a typical home automation architecture:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Remote -&lt;Z-wave&gt;- light switch -&lt;Z-wave&gt;- home hub -&lt;Ethernet&gt;- cloud server -&lt;GSM&gt;- phone&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You trigger the remote and it sends a Z-wave message to the switch, which turns on the light.  You can configure your home hub to send a message to the switch based on other rules (the garage door is opened.)  And your watch can talk to your phone which can contact the company's cloud, which sends the message to your home hub, which sends it to your light switch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Today, you can do the first part of this by setting up a scene in your light switch that is triggered by a paired remote.  Using Z-wave, no home hub is needed.  You can add a home hub and set up a new scene to trigger the light switch if the remote's button is pressed, but you better delete the scene in the light switch first.  You can use a cloud interface to configure your hub's behavior, perhaps triggering your hub via IFTTT.  And you can also use your phone to contact a web interface on the cloud and have it turn on the switch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What OpenFog is aiming to do is to have those device definitions be universal, the rules be platform independent, and the messages be transport independent.  They'll share common security and authentication methods.  That means you set it up once, no matter where you are, and the definitions and rules are migrated up and down the architecture.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From your phone you could view your devices, which would include the light switch and remote control, and say &quot;I want button 1 on the remote to toggle the light switch&quot;.  The rules might be created right there in your phone, then transported to the cloud server.  The cloud server could examine the inputs and decide &quot;All the responsibility for lights and remotes belongs at a lower level&quot;, and push the rules down to the home hub.  The home hub could say &quot;hey, Z-wave knows how to run a scene in this model of light switch, so I will push these rules to the light switch and remote.&quot;  Next time you push the button on the remote, the signal will be caught by the light switch and the light will turn on.  This would provide the fastest possible response time (no hub needed).  And by having the rules backed up at a cloud level, if you have to replace a defective light switch, none of the rules need to change.  They'd just be pushed back down to the replacement switch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;OpenFog also will provide for elastic scale.  Let's say you place 1000 light switches in an office building, using a network technology that has a latency that goes up exponentially based on the number of nodes.  It could scale communications such that the 1000 nodes are split into 10 networks, so that no network ever has a latency longer than 200 milliseconds.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It also specifies scalability of control.  If you've ever worked with systems built for GUI control you get used to instructions like these: &quot;right click on the node, pick 'settings', then set intensity to '75%', then 'OK'&quot;.  Such instructions are worse than useless when it comes to managing 60,000 nodes.  OpenFog should enable automated groupings of nodes allowing scalable control.  &quot;For all nodes in Eastern Standard Time zone, set intensity to 75%,&quot; or &quot;For all nodes in profit center 12, set intensity to 65%.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It also specifies autonomy where possible.  If the Peoria, Illinois branch replaces a furnace vent duct control, it shouldn't require an HQ person to delete the old control unit ID, then add the replacement ID.  The local maintenance person should be able to do that herself.  The security still has to ensure that the furnace repair person doesn't have the authority to disable the burglar alarm sensors on the back door.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, place all of this behind open standards so that a Honeywell burglar alarm and a Trane heating system all interoperate in the same logical network as your Philips light bulbs, Leviton Z-wave switches, and your Fitbit scale.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, is your SmartThings hub an OpenFog node?  Not today, and it won't be unless and until it implements and interoperates with these standards.  But a future home hub certainly could be an OpenFog node." />

This [reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/390u8h/parental_controls/) seems to suggest that there is no method of parental controls whatsoever:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [Are there any sort of parental controls available for the Echo?] Nope. They said that something about a family mode coming in the future that would also allow us to take it further the other way - unbleeped cussing. I'm bothered my phone Siri and Google Now can cuss and my home A.I. can't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I suggest asking them for this through feedback - maybe suggesting they allow us to customize it so it either bleeps swears AND limits explicit content or is a free-for-all so families and single adults can have different settings...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, there are some ways you can protect children, depending on your cause of concern.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Profanity&#xD;&#xA;A [GeekWire article](http://www.geekwire.com/2015/bleeping-awesome-amazon-echos-alexa-will-now-cuss-command/) discusses how Alexa will self-censor any swearing, especially in titles of music, videos and other media:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Yes, Alexa actually will bleep out part of a word that she is too modest to repeat. That may be the first mark of true artificial intelligence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Alexa will even [refuse to repeat swearing if you use the 'Simon says' command](https://www.cnet.com/uk/how-to/things-alexa-cant-do-yet/):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you use the &quot;Simon says&quot; command, Alexa will repeat anything you say. Even if you speak a number of expletives, Alexa will repeat your words, only the swearing will be bleeped out. Some people might wish she did otherwise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Unwanted Purchases&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since your Echo will be linked to an Amazon account, you may wish to [disable voice purchasing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201952610) to avoid children from unexpectedly buying things and leaving you a hefty bill to pay. Through the Alexa app, you can disable voice purchasing trivially easily.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Manners&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This may seem a rather odd point, but [some people object to the fact that Alexa will not encourage you to say 'please' and 'thank you'](http://qz.com/701521/parents-are-worried-the-amazon-echo-is-conditioning-their-kids-to-be-rude/). It seems rather unusual to worry about this in my opinion, but some people are concerned that since Alexa will respond even if you rudely command it, young children will start to believe that it is acceptable to just order people around.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is no software solution to this - you will simply have to encourage your children to *be nice*!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Overall, although there aren't any built-in parental controls, you should be relatively safe to use it around your children, provided that you take the precautions before letting your children use the device. Amazon *know* that many people have purchased an Echo specifically for their children, so it seems likely that they'll continue to enforce some protections such as the profanity filter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Can a skill set be developed/made available to implement Parental Control?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not without great difficulty. Expanding on my comment, you wouldn't be able to set any restrictions through a skill, because custom skills seem to be self-contained and can only respond when they are invoked. Unless you wanted to write a new, parental control-supporting skill for every feature you need, I don't think it's possible to create parental controls through an Alexa skill." />

Every byte you shave represents a savings of 1% of your current RF power budget. Sending any Boolean values? Use bit flags, not an ASCII 'Y' or 'N'. Make sure you're using the smallest possible container - don't transmit a 16-bit integer if the number has a permissible range of only 0-99. Most battery powered protocols try to squeeze it down as far as possible; e.g. if you're reporting on a 5x5 array of elements, the address only needs to be a 5-bit field, not an 8-bit byte. Using CPU cycles for compression-related logic results in a much lower overall power draw than transmitting unneeded bits.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the big power draw is the CPU (doubtful, but possible) can you do tricks like precomputed lookup tables, or even offload some of the work to a remote service?" />

Text="Following the [Wikipedia definition][1], to classify something as IoT, it needs to be the [internetworking][2] physical device embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity that enable these objects to collect and exchange data. In other words, the IoT *allows objects to be sensed and/or controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure*&lt;sup&gt;[Harvard][3]&lt;/sup&gt; by its direct integration into the physical world computer-based systems in order to provide improved efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit. The device should be able to operate to some extent interactively and autonomously.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other used names for such devices are &quot;connected devices&quot;, [&quot;smart devices&quot;][4], Internet of Everything, Machine-to-Machine communications or Industrial Internet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Internet of Things (IoT) has been also defined by [IoT-GSI][5] (The Global Standards Initiative on Internet of Things) in [Recommendation ITU-T Y.2060 (06/2012)][6] which clarifies the concept and scope of the IoT, identifies the fundamental characteristics and high-level requirements of the IoT.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The IoT, things are objects of the physical world (physical things) or of the information world (virtual world) which are capable of being identified and integrated into communication networks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Physical things exist in the physical world and are capable of being sensed, actuated and connected.&#xD;&#xA;Examples of physical things include the surrounding environment, industrial robots, goods and electrical equipment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The minimum requirement of the devices in the IoT is their support of communication capabilities.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, we can classify the IoT devices into the following groups:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Data-carrying device&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; A data-carrying device is attached to a physical thing to indirectly&#xD;&#xA;connect the physical thing with the communication networks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Data-capturing device&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; A data-capturing device refers to a reader/writer device with the&#xD;&#xA;capability to interact with physical things. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Sensing and actuating device&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; A sensing and actuating device may detect or measure&#xD;&#xA;information related to the surrounding environment and convert it into digital electronic signals. It may also convert digital electronic signals from the information networks into operations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- General device&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; A general device has embedded processing and communication capabilities&#xD;&#xA;and may communicate with the communication networks via wired or wireless&#xD;&#xA;technologies.

Yes, the actual temperature is not very private, but an attacker can provide false temperatures and cause an undesirable response (e.g turning heating on unneccesarily). This is how stuxnet worked, by misreporting the speed of the centrifuges, causing the control system to make them go faster until they broke.&#xD;&#xA; 2. It's difficult to tell the difference between a faulty device and a compromised device. Detection and repair of faults is difficult and costly, so not having to repair devices (or debug the entire system) is worth putting in some security.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Within a broader ecosystem you don't want some devices with encryption and some not, as this increases costs, maintenance, and management of devices. If you cannot say, for certain, that no private data will be transmitted in a few years' time on the system (not just the device), then it may be safer to engineer it now.&#xD;&#xA; 4.

The KNX Association had 339 members/manufacturers from 37 countries.

The Philips Hue is probably the best known.  But I think controlling bulbs directly is a rule-maintenance disaster waiting to happen.  If a bulb goes out (and yes, LED bulbs do fail), you have to replace the bulb, and remember to update any scenes or other rules that control the bulb (or are triggered by the bulb.)  Or if you move a bulb from fixture A in the kitchen to fixture B in the bedroom, (perhaps while cleaning), the rule that says &quot;Turn on kitchen lights&quot; will now illuminate the bedroom.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That may not seem like a big problem today for those of us who understand the configurations of our home automation systems intimately, but imagine a home automation system set up by a professional integrator for a typical customer.  The homeowner may not know how to change the rules, so replacing a lightbulb could cost them not only the price of the smart bulb, but an additional service call charge from the integration company.  A smart switch or fixture solves this problem because the switch doesn't move with typical maintenance.  (The switch offers the same problem of configuration if it fails and needs to be replaced, of course, but switches typically have better life expectancies than bulbs, which are generally considered consumables.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, an IoT enabled light switch can't fully control every aspect of lighting the same way a smart light bulb can.  A switch can do simple dimming for certain technologies of bulbs, but it can't control the color of the Hue bulb.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Much worse, smart switches use different types of electronic circuitry to perform dimming, and must be carefully matched to the technology of the bulbs they are controlling.  A typical older dimmer can dim only incandescent bulbs and not CFL or LED bulbs; some dimmers can dim both incandescent and CFL but not LED bulbs; some dimmers can control incandescent bulbs and LED bulbs, but not CFLs; and some dimmers can control inductive loads like halogen transformers, but not CFLs or LEDs!  With incandescent bulbs being replaced because they're such energy wasters, this has been a real problem, too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So what's the most practical approach?  Buy expensive bulbs that are directly controllable and expensive smart switches to control them, or buy cheap bulbs and just expensive smart switches, and give up on the idea of controllable color lighting?

For the average consumer, I think it is fairly important that if it has a B22 or E27 fitting, it can simply be replaced with an arbitrary similar bulb.

As noted in [this CNet article](https://www.cnet.com/uk/news/smart-bulbs-vs-smart-switches-the-pros-and-cons-of-connected-lighting/):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; With a smart switch, you're free to use whatever bulb you want -- perfect if you're picky about light quality, or if your fixture requires bulbs of a particular size, shape, or style that's incompatible with smart bulbs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, the customisation issue goes the other way too. With a 'smart bulb' such as the Philips Hue, you gain the ability to change the bulb colour as well as the brightness and on/off state. With a smart switch, I would imagine that colour changing is impractical, because the switch is 'dumb' and doesn't know what's connected to it, just like your regular light switch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Installation/Setup&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is another issue with advantages and disadvantages for both options. A smart switch will need to be wired in to the lighting circuit to control your lights, which is nowhere near as straightforward as simply plugging in a bulb, as with most smart bulbs. Of course, if the bulb doesn't fit in the first place, you're going to have a problem using the smart bulb, but *most* light fixtures use standard sizes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, a smart bulb is likely to need more setup, and some require a hub as well, which adds to the setup time and complexity. The majority of smart switches on the market seem to connect via Wi-Fi, and hence do not require an additional hub.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Cost&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a far more difficult issue to quantify, since there is such a diverse range of products on the market. I've just picked some relatively popular products for the example, and this will vary widely depending on the exact products chosen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The [Philips Hue starter kit](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-464495-Ambiance-Starter-Generation/dp/B01KJYSO68/ref=sr_1_2?s=hi&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483469586&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=philips+hue), which provides three bulbs and a hub, costs $199.99.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To compare, the [WeMo Light Switch](https://www.amazon.com/WeMo-Light-Switch-enabled-Amazon/dp/B00DGEGJ02/ref=sr_1_1?s=hi&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483469773&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=smart+light+switch+dimmer+wifi) is $47.94 (each), so $143.82 for 3 switches. However, you do **not** get the dimming and colour changing options with this, so it may be worth deciding whether those functions are worth the additional $56.17.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 'Graceful degradation'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many smart bulbs will simply stop working altogether if you turn the proper light switch off, because they require power to operate, so they can't respond to wireless control. A smart switch won't have this problem - it's always connected to power and ready to respond - so it will be far more intuitive to the users of your system to use smart switches.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also heard a highly useful rule of thumb when designing a smart home - it should be simple enough that both a 5-year-old and and 80-year-old can understand it without needing to be taught. In the case of a smart switch, you'll have no problems - it works just like any other switch, and toggling it will toggle the light, whether physically or wirelessly. A smart bulb might fail this test - switching it off physically then on wirelessly **doesn't work**, which is likely to confuse anyone who finds this problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The rule of thumb I mentioned is helpful to ensure that your IoT architecture doesn't get so complex that you can't operate it normally. In other words, if you can't operate your lights like you could before, **you're doing it wrong!**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In summary, think about these points and decide which is best for you:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Do you **need** dimming and colour changing? If so, pick a **smart bulb**.&#xD;&#xA;- Are you able to wire up a smart switch electrically, and want the choice of any 'dumb' bulb to use in your lights? **Pick a smart switch**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Above all, I'd suggest **not** mixing the two systems together - this way, the user of the home can learn how the system works and all their lights will work the same way - mixing two systems will lead to more confusion for little gain." />

[According to your TV's manual][1] (on page 100), your TV draws 0.2W of power in standby.  Using your figure of 0.28€/kW as a cost of electricity, the standby power drawn by your TV will add no more than 0.49€ per year to your electric bill.  Given the life of a TV may be 20 years, that means your workaround would have to cost less than 10.00€ to ever pay for itself.  Furthermore, your TV will consume electricity at the full-power rate of 131/kWh during the entire system's cold boot sequence, which probably takes more time than a warm boot.  (The longer it takes your whole system to boot up to &quot;watchable TV&quot;, the more useless electricity it draws; similarly, I've found that family members are typically less pleased the longer it takes for the TV to power up.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Financially, there is little reason to pursue this. Environmentally, it is probably not as advantageous as you think.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Safety&#xD;&#xA;-&#xD;&#xA;Smart plugs are not rated to isolate their plugged-in devices from lightning strikes, so merely shutting off the smart plug won't protect the TV from surges or spikes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Privacy&#xD;&#xA;-&#xD;&#xA;If you're concerned about privacy and network activity while your smart TV is supposed to be &quot;powered off&quot;, go into your TV's settings and disable the phone home capabilities.  If you're still worried, powering it off won't help because they leak personal data when they're on (and you're watching it), not when they're in standby.  In that case you should instead fix the leak by shielding the TV behind a network firewall that prevents it from ever reporting back to the factory. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.manualscat.com/en/toshiba-42sl863g-manual" />

It is the successor to, and convergence of, 3 previous standards: EHS, BatiBUS and EIB.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;KNX is currently the de facto standard in building automation in Europe. The KNX Association had 339 members/manufacturers from 37 countries. The KNX Association has partnership agreements with more than 30,000 installer companies in 100 countries and more than 60 technical universities as well as over 150 training centres. Member companies have more than 7000 KNX certified product in their catalogues.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Until recently, KNX did not have support for support for TCP. While there has been [an IP based implementation of KNX named KNXNet][2] for quite a while now, this protocol uses UDP as the transport layer, which is not very programmer-friendly and rather poorly supported in comparison with TCP.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Only recently did the KNX Association release [a KNX Standard extension for KNX web services][3]. This means that there is now an official standard for implementing RESTful web services, which makes it far easier to integrate the KNX eco-system with other technology:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![KNX_Architecture][4]][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The KNX WS specification foresees three flavors to ease the integration with an existing ecosystem: oBIX, BACnet/WS and OPC/UA. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;__________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###The actual question&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm currently having a basic KNX home automation installed in my home by a certified installer. I would like to purchase such a gateway to implement a custom web + mobile UI for my home, but I've been informed by both my installer and the KNX Association that no commercial solutions are on the market that support the new web services extention out of the box... yet *(\*)*. Neither seems to have any idea whatsoever when such a gateway might become available on the market.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Does anyone here know if any major brands are working on such a gateway and when the first gateways of this kind are expected to be released?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Are there currently conventional KNX/IP gateways out there that can be extended with KNX WS at the software level, so I don't need any additional hardware (like a NAS or a Raspberry Pi) to extend them with KNX WS support?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately, this kind of information is very, very hard to find anywhere online.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;_________&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*(\*) Note : While there are a whole bunch of commercial KNX/IP gateways, but none of these the brand new KNX WS standard, which has been released just a few months ago. The gateways currently on the market either only support KNXNet or some proprietary TCP-based protocol, neither of which are what I'm looking for!*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.knx.org/fileadmin/template/documents/downloads_support_menu/KNX_tutor_seminar_page/tutor_documentation/08_IP%20Communication_E0510a.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://www.knx.org/media/docs/Flyers/KNX-IoT/KNX-IoT_en.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/22D1Y.png" />

I could play them directly from the receiver, play them using the TV using HDMI-returned sound, or use my smartphone to access the musical collection and play the sound with the receiver. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Synology serves the musical files using Media Server. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To summarise, the situation was like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* BubbpleUPnP could see the musical collection on Synology and could see the receiver.&#xD;&#xA;* Receiver could see the musical collection on Synology and could see the BubbleUPnP.&#xD;&#xA;* TV could see the musical collection on Synology.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Everything worked fine, until some moment.

It does see BubbleUPnP.&#xD;&#xA;* TV can see Synology just fine, with all media files.&#xD;&#xA;* Synology's Media Server shows TV, BubbleUPnP and receiver in Media Server &gt; DMA Compatibility &gt; Device List. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Two DLNA channels work just fine: TV—Synology and BubbleUPnP—receiver.&#xD;&#xA;* Two DLNA channels work one way: Synology sees BubbleUPnP and receiver, but not the other way round.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I wonder if there is a &quot;standard&quot; or recommended approach to debugging such configuration.

For the average consumer, I think it is fairly important that if it has a B22 or E27 fitting, it can simply be replaced with an arbitrary similar bulb. Surely, the larger manufacturers will see this as a critical point too.

The approach I take is to first document each network interface on each device, including routers, access points, and POWERlan adapters. Record the MAC address, IP address, default gateway, netmask, and hostname. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, go to your main DHCP server (probably in your home router) and make sure its logs show the exact same MAC addresses you recorded, and that each MAC was issued the exact same IP addresses you saw. A difference may mean you've accidentally enabled a second DHCP server (perhaps hidden in a cheap access point, WiFi range extender, or POWERlan adapter) which could be creating false network settings in some of your devices, slicing your network in two. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Make sure all your devices are in the same subnet. That means they all have the same netmask, and the topmost bits are all the same as each other. For example, if your router's netmask is 255.255.255.0, then all your devices should have their top 3 octets in common with the default gateway and each other, such as 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2, and 192.168.1.3&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a small home network such as you've described, I'd expect all devices to share a common default gateway. Make sure it's the internal network facing IP address of your router.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you think it may be a rogue DHCP problem but just can't figure out what's going on, consider converting all your network interfaces to use static IP addresses." />

(Switches can be controlled remotely and manually as well.)&#xD;&#xA; - Be able to handle proximity sensors several ones per room.&#xD;&#xA; - I want the system to be able to handle smart air conditioners (these should be controlled remotely and be able to give feedback about temperature and humidity values.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, I have a lot of devices with low bandwidth requirements and the main goal is to have a system that is as scalable as possible. So if I move to a twice as big house which needs almost twice as much sensors, I want it to be the easiest to install the additional ones.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now I know the basic advantages and disadvantages of the two compared. It is listed at this site [Bluetooth vs. Wi-Fi][1] (the image is taken from here as well).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Comparison of BlueTooth and Wi-Fi][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To highlight: Some Bluetooth is cheap and easier to use. However, Wi-Fi is more secure, has a higher range and bandwidth but, of course, costs more.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So the question is: At the dawn of a project, how can one decide which one will be the more suitable for the task?

As noted in [this CNet article](https://www.cnet.com/uk/news/smart-bulbs-vs-smart-switches-the-pros-and-cons-of-connected-lighting/):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; With a smart switch, you're free to use whatever bulb you want -- perfect if you're picky about light quality, or if your fixture requires bulbs of a particular size, shape, or style that's incompatible with smart bulbs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, the customisation issue goes the other way too. With a 'smart bulb' such as the Philips Hue, you gain the ability to change the bulb colour as well as the brightness and on/off state. With a smart switch, I would imagine that colour changing is impractical, because the switch is 'dumb' and doesn't know what's connected to it, just like your regular light switch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Installation/Setup&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is another issue with advantages and disadvantages for both options. A smart switch will need to be wired in to the lighting circuit to control your lights, which is nowhere near as straightforward as simply plugging in a bulb, as with most smart bulbs. Of course, if the bulb doesn't fit in the first place, you're going to have a problem using the smart bulb, but *most* light fixtures use standard sizes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, a smart bulb is likely to need more setup, and some require a hub as well, which adds to the setup time and complexity. The majority of smart switches on the market seem to connect via Wi-Fi, and hence do not require an additional hub.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Cost&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a far more difficult issue to quantify, since there is such a diverse range of products on the market. I've just picked some relatively popular products for the example, and this will vary widely depending on the exact products chosen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The [Philips Hue starter kit](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-464495-Ambiance-Starter-Generation/dp/B01KJYSO68/ref=sr_1_2?s=hi&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483469586&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=philips+hue), which provides three bulbs and a hub, costs $199.99.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To compare, the [WeMo Light Switch](https://www.amazon.com/WeMo-Light-Switch-enabled-Amazon/dp/B00DGEGJ02/ref=sr_1_1?s=hi&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483469773&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=smart+light+switch+dimmer+wifi) is $47.94 (each), so $143.82 for 3 switches. However, you do **not** get the dimming and colour changing options with this, so it may be worth deciding whether those functions are worth the additional $56.17.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## 'Graceful degradation'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many smart bulbs will simply stop working altogether if you turn the proper light switch off, because they require power to operate, so they can't respond to wireless control. A smart switch won't have this problem - it's always connected to power and ready to respond - so it will be far more intuitive to the users of your system to use smart switches.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also heard a highly useful rule of thumb when designing a smart home - it should be simple enough that both a 5-year-old and and 80-year-old can understand it without needing to be taught. In the case of a smart switch, you'll have no problems - it works just like any other switch, and toggling it will toggle the light, whether physically or wirelessly. A smart bulb might fail this test - switching it off physically then on wirelessly **doesn't work**, which is likely to confuse anyone who finds this problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The rule of thumb I mentioned is helpful to ensure that your IoT architecture doesn't get so complex that you can't operate it normally. In other words, if you can't operate your lights like you could before, **you're doing it wrong!**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In summary, think about these points and decide which is best for you:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Do you **need** dimming and colour changing? If so, pick a **smart bulb**.&#xD;&#xA;- Are you able to wire up a smart switch electrically, and want the choice of any 'dumb' bulb to use in your lights? If this is the case, **pick a smart switch**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Above all, I'd suggest **not** mixing the two systems together - this way, the user of the home can learn how the system works and all their lights will work the same way - mixing two systems will lead to more confusion for little gain." />

It inspects all packages going through it for known bugs.**  From [TrustedReviews.com](http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/norton-core-secure-router-for-smart-home-devices):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The Core is a combination of Symantec's pre-existing security knowhow and some new features we’ve not seen before. The router will inspect every packet of data that passes through it for known pieces of malware and other naughties. This is a common feature in business networking products but is seldom found in kit for use in the home.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short, it's a kind of firewall which is right on the entrypoint to your home, so it filters all traffic going to and from your home.  Therefore, it isn't up to each individual computer to have their own security implementations and updates; the router itself is doing the protection.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**2. Frequent updates.**  According to the [Norton Community](https://community.norton.com/en/forums/how-often-do-norton-make-updates-available-each-package), updates are run hourly, meaning that security compromises can be rapidly dealt with on a home level.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**3. Multiple networking.** You will be able to set up more than one network, so that any hacking would have to move through your router to another network, allowing for more detailed screening.  Back on the Trusted Reviews page, apparently...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;You'll also be able to move your most vulnerable devices, such as smart home kit, onto a completely separate network, making it much harder for a compromised device to open the door to the rest of your home network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**4. Security score.**  The Norton Core is constantly monitoring all individual devices on the network to feel out any security leaks on individual devices, such as out of date devices.  From [Norton's Website](https://us.norton.com/core), which you referenced:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Core monitors data from your entire connected home, identifies security issues, and sums it all up in a single, powerful number. If there’s ever a problem, Core jumps in with real-time insights and tools to get you back on track." />

We will never get cheap-as-possible manufacturers to implement some yet-to-be-defined security protocol. And, as much as we try and educate consumers, people will buy on price, not security (which may be too complex for them to understand).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's easy to solve the problem at the network level. Less trustworthy devices can be put on a separate network, where leaking of wifi passwords causes less of a problem, devices can be firewalled, and traffic can be monitored. Although this could, in theory, be done with existing routers, it requires a level of networking skill, and interest/desire to maintain the network, that does not exist with most consumers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The solution is better UIs so that consumers can interact with routers in a way that hides complexity, and more 'intelligence', possibly packaged as 'home networking as a service'. The Norton Core seems to be doing (at least) these two things, and as a result goes a long way to improving home network security, which in turn reduces the risk of rogue IoT devices.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So while people with networking skills and interests may find better products to solve their problems, for the average consumer, the Norton Core seems to be a move in the right direction." />

CMUA's&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Finger server was modified to run the Coke status program whenever&#xD;&#xA;&gt; someone fingered the nonexistent user &quot;coke&quot;. (For the uninitiated,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Finger normally reports whether a specified user is logged in, and if&#xD;&#xA;&gt; so where.) Since Finger requests are part of standard ARPANET (now&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Internet) protocols, people could check the Coke machine from any CMU&#xD;&#xA;&gt; computer by saying &quot;finger coke@cmua&quot;. In fact, you could discover the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Coke machine's status from any machine anywhere on the Internet!  Not&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that it would do you much good if you were a few thousand miles away...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the first generation Coke Machine, in the 70s and 80s, the `finger` command was (ab)used while connecting through [ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET), the precursor of the Internet. Not exactly a complex protocol, but it worked well enough to indicate the state of the coke machine without being overly difficult to set up.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you're interested in *exactly* how the [`finger` command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_protocol) worked, here is an extract from Wikipedia detailing how it operates:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The finger daemon runs on TCP port 79. The client will (in the case of remote hosts) open a connection to port 79. An RUIP (Remote User Information Program) is started on the remote end of the connection to process the request. The local host sends the RUIP one line query based upon the Finger query specification, and waits for the RUIP to respond. The RUIP receives and processes the query, returns an answer, then initiates the close of the connection. The local host receives the answer and the close signal, then proceeds closing its end of the connection.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The `finger` command can also provide some custom information, such as full name, email address, and some custom text. Presumably the custom text was used to send the state of the Coke Machine and the coldness of the Cokes inside.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

And I came to the conclusion that for me, smart switches are the way to go.  And the primary reason is that for a smart bulb to work, the light switch has to already be on.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So what to do about making sure the switch stays on?  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Eliminate the switch by bypassing the wiring?&#xD;&#xA; - By putting tape over it?  &#xD;&#xA; - By telling everyone &quot;don't turn off this switch?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I didn't like any of those options, so I decided to go the switch route for now.  My goal now is for outside lighting mainly.  I have not decided how I will actually use them properly yet.  Put a Echo Dot outside, use the manufacturers app via phone, write an app for my phone that senses proximity to my house via GPS or Wifi and turns my outside lights on if its dark?  TBD.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The only use that I could come up with for using the bulbs is to have individual bulbs separately addressable that are currently on the same circuit - E.G. reading lamps next to lounger, sofa, etc.  I don't care about the color aspect other than I like warm over cold, but dimming would be something I might want in the future but don't care about at the moment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So for me right now... switches." />

Wi-Fi devices can often forgo such hubs and can be directly controlled via App or Alexa and the like. Thus, you should consider your use case.

This is a very important point here." Text="Absolutely, because:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. A secure device and channel means that you can **trust the data**. Yes, the actual temperature is not very private, but an attacker can provide false temperatures and cause an undesirable response (e.g turning heating on unneccesarily). This is how stuxnet worked, by misreporting the speed of the centrifuges, causing the control system to make them go faster until they broke. Note that a secure channel is not only encrypted, but **authenticated** and **integrity-protected**. Integrity is what matters here.  &#xD;&#xA;   Encryption alone does not let you trust the data: an attacker can modify encrypted data even if they don't know exactly what they're modifying. Even authentication alone does not let you fully trust the data, as authentic data can be replayed. You need a protocol that guarantees data integrity.&#xD;&#xA; 2. It's difficult to tell the difference between a faulty device and a compromised device. Detection and repair of faults is difficult and costly, so not having to repair devices (or debug the entire system) is worth putting in some security.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Within a broader ecosystem you don't want some devices with encryption and some not, as this increases costs, maintenance, and management of devices. If you cannot say, for certain, that no private data will be transmitted in a few years' time on the system (not just the device), then it may be safer to engineer it now.&#xD;&#xA; 4. Your definition of private data may be wrong, and unless you're checking it with auditors and regulatory experts across the regions in which you operate, assume that the data is private. GPS co-ordinates, and even IP addresses can be considered personally identifiable by some regulatory frameworks. " />

[Deep Packet inspection][1].**  From [TrustedReviews.com](http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/norton-core-secure-router-for-smart-home-devices):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The Core is a combination of Symantec's pre-existing security knowhow and some new features we’ve not seen before. The router will inspect every packet of data that passes through it for known pieces of malware and other naughties. This is a common feature in business networking products but is seldom found in kit for use in the home.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short, it's a kind of firewall which is right on the entrypoint to your home, so it filters all traffic going to and from your home.  Therefore, even if an individual computer's security is compromised, there is a second line of defence.  As @jpmc26 mentioned in the comments below, it is certainly not a fail-proof security wall: malicious hackers can take other routes.  However, it helps tighten up the security on your network *in case* the security on an individual device is compromised temporarily.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**2. Frequent updates.**  According to the [Norton Community](https://community.norton.com/en/forums/how-often-do-norton-make-updates-available-each-package), updates are run hourly, meaning that security compromises can be rapidly dealt with on a home level.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**3. Multiple networking.** You will be able to set up more than one network, so that any hacking would have to move through your router to another network, allowing for more detailed screening.  Back on the Trusted Reviews page, apparently...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;You'll also be able to move your most vulnerable devices, such as smart home kit, onto a completely separate network, making it much harder for a compromised device to open the door to the rest of your home network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**4. Security score.**  The Norton Core is constantly monitoring all individual devices on the network to feel out any security leaks on individual devices, such as out of date devices.  From [Norton's Website](https://us.norton.com/core), which you referenced:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Core monitors data from your entire connected home, identifies security issues, and sums it all up in a single, powerful number. If there’s ever a problem, Core jumps in with real-time insights and tools to get you back on track.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection" />

However, it is a patented proprietary protocol that requires a licensed Z-Wave chip, which are not generally available to the hobbyist at affordable rates.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To communicate, Z-Wave devices must be joined to the same Z-Wave mesh network. That means you need to have a primary controller somewhere, at least for the purpose of pairing. The primary controller does not have to be present when the scene executes; and the primary controller does not necessarily have to be connected to the Internet (but that's not very IoT.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some commercial Z-Wave switches are &quot;scene capable&quot;, meaning you can install and use them as a typical wall switch, and they can trigger behavior directly in other Z-wave devices without needing to send a message to the primary controller. Usually this is fairly primitive, meaning you can have one light switch turn on several other light switches, but nothing more sophisticated. &#xD;&#xA;" />

For example, the easiest way I can imagine is as follows; all it would need is a phone or similar with NFC capabilities. (Only hypothetically, because this assumes NFC etc can do it!)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. User powers up IoT device&#xD;&#xA;2. User holds phone against IoT device's NFC pad&#xD;&#xA;3. IoT device asks phone for WiFi credentials&#xD;&#xA;4. IoT device uses credentials to connect to WiFi&#xD;&#xA;5. IoT device directs phone's browser to its URL&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But right away I can see possible flaws: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Phone is unlikely to want to give credentials away; security risk.&#xD;&#xA; - Phone is unlikely to want to nagivate to the given URL; security risk.&#xD;&#xA; - NFC probably doesn't have defined standards for these kinds of operations; even if security issues are mitigated (e.g. by asking user permission), I can't believe I'd be lucky enough for this to be implemented. So an app would have to be downloaded for the phone to do all this. Which means an app would need to be written for Apple, another for Android etc, plus in the case of Apple it would have to be approved, and either way the user would have to search for it, install it and learn how to use it - all defeating the purpose of having a web interface. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Obviously some users will not have NFC-compatible phones, so there would also have to be a secondary method. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The only awareness of a solution I have comes from how my WiFi IP security camera works. It requires first connecting it via Ethernet cable to a router with on a 192.168.1.X subnet with a given IP reserved (e.g. my camera required 192.168.1.100 to be reserved or free). Then from there, the user navigates to http://192.168.1.100/, logs in with the camera's supplied username and password, then from there, configures the camera with the WiFi access point name and password. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But that method had one serious disadvantage: it required that the router operates on the subnet 192.168.1.X. Mine operated on 192.168.0.X. Thankfully I was able to reconfigure it. But my new router doesn't have that ability!! I would have been stuck. Additionally, the above method is quite a pain; quite a few steps. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What other solutions have been implemented to solve the problem of setting up an IoT device's WiFi connection, and then informing the user of its IP address so he/she can access its web interface?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

For example, the easiest way I can imagine is as follows; all it would need is a phone or similar with NFC capabilities. (Only hypothetically, because this assumes NFC etc can do it!)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. User powers up IoT device&#xD;&#xA;2. User holds phone against IoT device's NFC pad&#xD;&#xA;3. IoT device asks phone for WiFi credentials&#xD;&#xA;4. IoT device uses credentials to connect to WiFi&#xD;&#xA;5. IoT device directs phone's browser to its URL&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But right away I can see possible flaws: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Phone is unlikely to want to give credentials away; security risk.&#xD;&#xA; - Phone is unlikely to want to navigate to the given URL; security risk.&#xD;&#xA; - NFC probably doesn't have defined standards for these kinds of operations; even if security issues are mitigated (e.g. by asking user permission), I can't believe I'd be lucky enough for this to be implemented. So an app would have to be downloaded for the phone to do all this. Which means an app would need to be written for Apple, another for Android etc, plus in the case of Apple it would have to be approved, and either way the user would have to search for it, install it and learn how to use it - all defeating the purpose of having a web interface. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Obviously some users will not have NFC-compatible phones, so there would also have to be a secondary method. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The only awareness of a solution I have comes from how my WiFi IP security camera works. It requires first connecting it via Ethernet cable to a router with on a 192.168.1.X subnet with a given IP reserved (e.g. my camera required 192.168.1.100 to be reserved or free). Then from there, the user navigates to http://192.168.1.100/, logs in with the camera's supplied username and password, then from there, configures the camera with the WiFi access point name and password. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But that method had one serious disadvantage: it required that the router operates on the subnet 192.168.1.X. Mine operated on 192.168.0.X. Thankfully I was able to reconfigure it. But my new router doesn't have that ability!! I would have been stuck. Additionally, the above method is quite a pain; quite a few steps. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What other solutions have been implemented to solve the problem of setting up an IoT device's WiFi connection, and then informing the user of its IP address so he/she can access its web interface?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Along with the WPS idea that I initially suggested, they have a few other options:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Another common approach is to have the coffee maker appear as an access point with its own SSID and pass phrase, which is supplied on the manufacturer's quick start card. In this approach, when the coffee maker is plugged in and powered on the SSID of the coffee maker is broadcast so that it is easily identified. A user disconnects from the wireless network, connects wirelessly and directly to the coffee maker, and navigates to an area to enter the SSID and network pass phrase. The device is then configured as a client on the user's network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This method would seem most practical for any network where you are unable to use WPS (no WPS support from your router, perhaps, or [concerns about WPS security](http://www.howtogeek.com/176124/wi-fi-protected-setup-wps-is-insecure-heres-why-you-should-disable-it/)). Of course, it is quite involved and would require more technical knowledge, so it's not ideal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All of these methods I've outlined only really work if you're in control of the *design* of the IoT device - as a consumer, if the device's connection method doesn't work, it's essentially tough luck - the only option is to return it to the store!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Disappointingly, this doesn't seem to be the case - the hairbrush still requires you to manually brush your hair, but it does have an awful lot of sensors to take advantage of:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Kérastase Hair Coach Powered by Withings minimizes these risks, taking advantage of multiple sensors that provide information on the quality of hair and brushing patterns. These include: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - A microphone that listens to the sound of hair brushing to identify patterns, providing insights into manageability, frizziness, dryness, split ends and breakage.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; - 3-axis load cells that measure the force applied to the hair and the scalp when brushing. &#xD;&#xA;&gt; - An accelerometer and a gyroscope which help further analyze brushing patterns and count brush strokes, with haptic feedback signaling if brushing is too vigorous.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Conductivity sensors to determine if the brush is being used on dry or wet hair in order to provide an accurate hair measurement. The brush itself is splash proof.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(from the [Press Release](http://www.loreal.com/media/press-releases/2017/jan/kerastase-and-withings-unveil-worlds-first-smart-hairbrush-at-ces-2017) you linked)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With this information, I think there's a lot of choice for what to use the brush for. [New Statesman](http://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/technology/2017/01/160-smart-hairbrush-symbolises-big-problem-internet-things) has a rather nefarious idea for what could be done:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Munro hasn’t yet looked at the Hair Coach, but he speculates about the security of any IoT device with a microphone and internet connection. “Listening to hair breakage requires a microphone, so can it hear more than just breaks? It’s clearly very sensitive, so could it detect human voice and potentially become a spy bug?”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You could, in theory, take advantage of the hair brush's microphone to act as a sound detector (perhaps for security?), although I doubt the microphone is particularly sensitive - its original purpose only requires it to pick up sounds within a 10 or 20 centimetre radius. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even so, if you put the brush in a key location, the microphone could perhaps detect someone walking past, and you could write some software to push a notification to your phone and inform you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's hard to know exactly how (or *if*) this could be done without more information on the product, which we can't know until it's released, but I'm sure if you were inventive enough, you could overwrite whatever code they have installed (unless the device only contains read-only memory, which is a strong possibility).&#xD;&#xA;" />

D-Link *assures* it is easy to secure a camera, but in fact no, people must have a strong knowledge of Wifi protocols (WPA,...) and these settings are hidden behind all the menus of the camera web interface.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With my first point, I would say &quot;all the devices&quot; are impacted since the user must enable security. So, to answer your question: how?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Change the default password of the admin account!!!!**&#xD;&#xA; - If possible, rename the network host via the web interface or via your router, in that case if an attacker finds your device on the network, he won't know it is a [insert brand] camera.&#xD;&#xA; - Don't expose your camera's port with your router, unless it is a public camera and you have set a guest account.&#xD;&#xA; - *Proxyfy* your camera: make a webserver perform all the queries to your camera so you can have a visual monitor of who made which queries." />

That sensor has a custom response and trigger which makes me doubt there is a standard ZigBee module out there which converts a command to that 10 µs trigger and reports back the response in verbatim. Thus, you'll need some sort of microcontroller with your ZigBee module to perform that task.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'd probably get that microcontroller, the ZigBee module and a circuit prevent short circuiting on a board outside the well for humidity reasons and lead a four wire cable inside to the sensor. Since the sensor has only four meters of range it has to be very close to the potential high water maximum mark. Putting a small cable inside the well gets the other electronics out of range and puts the ZigBee module in a better position to relay the information to the Raspberry Pi.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, you can also put the MCU, the ZigBee module and the sensor in a water-proof casing inside the well.

According to her parents' Amazon account, their daughter said: &quot;Can you play dollhouse with me and get me a dollhouse?&quot; Next thing they knew, a $160 KidKraft Sparkle Mansion dollhouse and four pounds of sugar cookies arrived on their doorstep.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; During that story's segment, a CW-6 news presenter remarked: &quot;I love the little girl, saying 'Alexa ordered me a dollhouse'.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; That, apparently, was enough to set off Alexa-powered Echo boxes around San Diego on their own shopping sprees. The California station admitted plenty of viewers complained that the TV broadcast caused their voice-controlled personal assistants to try to place orders for dollhouses on Amazon.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Voice purchasing seems to be enabled by default on the Echo, if you have 1-Click Purchasing set up. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How can I stop Alexa from ordering things if an advertisement or TV show says the words *&quot;Alexa, order ____&quot;*?

The medical professionals (and to some extent the laboratory equipment manufacturers) are pushing back against these low-cost, continuous measurment sensors, because they're not accurate - but failing to appreciate that there are probably other gains to be made from replacing high precision with high volume data (both in time, and across populations).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In common with lots of embedded applications, the Fitbit doesn't measure calorie burn directly. What it does it take some more tractable measurements and user data to provide an estimate based on identified modes of activity (for example -sleeping, jogging, walking). Across a group of individuals, there is potential for significant variation between the observed parameters and actual calorie burn.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where the data can be expected to be more accurate is in comparing relative calorie burn with different days for a specific individual, and the obvious advantage is the trivial instrumentation overhead compared with attempting any precision calorimitry in an open-air activity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Its important to appreciate that the calorie number is an estimate, but when does anyone care about anything precise with calories? Even with blood pressure, the value is being able to identify changes over time in the majority of even medically monitored applications (rather than one-off diagnostic measurements).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some effort does need to be made to formalise the value of herd measurements like this, educate professionals to work with low quality data, and educate users to appreciate this cheap data is not always individually informative." />

That limits the lengths of the wake word due to obvious processing limitations. Furthermore users don't want to recite a poem to activate the smart assistant. Thus, ***it has to be short.***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It has to work with an almost 100% accuracy when called and also *not recognized* with that certainty when not called for. That makes problems and also makes for a ***minimum length for wake words.*** Amazon's choice to allow *Echo* is quite surprising since it's just two [phonemes][3].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we look at the usual suspects, we have *Alexa (3 phonemes), Amazon (3), Echo (2), Ok Google (3), Hey Cortana (4),* and *Hey Siri (3).* All industry giants almost agree on three being a good choice number of phonemes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Strangely enough the most wanted wake word *&quot;computer&quot;* has also three phonemes and would match that requirement easily. It's also not trademarked.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As the blog—and reason—tells us, we totally want to avoid false positives. Let's have a look about how established the words Computer, Siri, Cortana and Alexa are. This is the Google book corpus from 2008.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![NgramGoogleBooks][4]][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Exactly, Siri and Alexa are virtually flatlining against *computer* and *Cortana* gives an error. Not found. Makes sense since the corpus is from 2008. To give us some more perspective why *computer* is a terrible wake word another graph.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![AnotherNgram][6]][7]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This Ngram shows the two most popular US baby names of 2016 (for currency), as well as Tom and Dave also flatline against *computer*.

I was assuming that when audio data becomes available at the source, the firmware should generate `MESSAGE_MORE_DATA` and the program control should transfer into `aud_inp_handler()`, but it's not happening. I should point out that when I use `StreamConnect()` to connect the source and sink together, but forcefully terminate this connection, the firmware generates a `MESSAGE_STREAM_DISCONNECT` message, which gets captured by the `aud_inp_handler()` function, so the function itself has been registered properly to detect firmware messages, which leads me to believe that audio is not coming from the audio hardware to the audio source buffer in the first place.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How can I set up indirect (managed) connection of source and sink here?   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;PS: I cannot make new tags related to CSR or ADK and I cannot find any generic pre-created  tags that match my situation.

I was assuming that when audio data becomes available at the source, the firmware should generate `MESSAGE_MORE_DATA` and the program control should transfer into `aud_inp_handler()`, but it's not happening. I should point out that when I use `StreamConnect()` to connect the source and sink together, but forcefully terminate this connection, the firmware generates a `MESSAGE_STREAM_DISCONNECT` message, which gets captured by the `aud_inp_handler()` function, so the function itself has been registered properly to detect firmware messages, which leads me to believe that audio is not coming from the audio hardware to the audio source buffer in the first place.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How can I set up indirect (managed) connection of source and sink here?   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/610/intel-spi-flash-descriptor&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://meta.iot.stackexchange.com/questions/178/on-topicness-of-embedded-programming-questions?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

That limits the lengths of the wake word due to obvious processing limitations. Furthermore users don't want to recite a poem to activate the smart assistant. Thus, ***it has to be short.***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It has to work with an almost 100% accuracy when called and also *not recognized* with that certainty when not called for. That makes problems and also makes for a ***minimum length for wake words.*** Amazon's choice to allow *Echo* is quite surprising since it's just two [syllables][3].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we look at the usual suspects, we have *Alexa (3 syllables), Amazon (3), Echo (2), Ok Google (4), Hey Cortana (4),* and *Hey Siri (3).* All industry giants almost agree on three being a good choice number of syllables.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Strangely enough the most wanted wake word *&quot;computer&quot;* has also three syllables and would match that requirement easily. It's also not trademarked.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As the blog—and reason—tells us, we totally want to avoid false positives. Let's have a look about how established the words Computer, Siri, Cortana and Alexa are. This is the Google book corpus from 2008.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![NgramGoogleBooks][4]][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Exactly, Siri and Alexa are virtually flatlining against *computer* and *Cortana* gives an error. Not found. Makes sense since the corpus is from 2008. To give us some more perspective why *computer* is a terrible wake word another graph.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![AnotherNgram][6]][7]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This Ngram shows the two most popular US baby names of 2016 (for currency), as well as Tom and Dave also flatline against *computer*. Queen, basketball and police manage to register properly. Anyhow this gives us an idea why *Computer, Earl Grey, Hot* hasn't been allowed so far.

I was assuming that when audio data becomes available at the source, the firmware should generate `MESSAGE_MORE_DATA` and the program control should transfer into `aud_inp_handler()`, but it's not happening. I should point out that when I use `StreamConnect()` to connect the source and sink together, but forcefully terminate this connection, the firmware generates a `MESSAGE_STREAM_DISCONNECT` message, which gets captured by the `aud_inp_handler()` function, so the function itself has been registered properly to detect firmware messages, which leads me to believe that audio is not coming from the audio hardware to the audio source buffer in the first place.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How can I set up indirect (managed) connection of source and sink here?   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/610/intel-spi-flash-descriptor&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://meta.iot.stackexchange.com/questions/178/on-topicness-of-embedded-programming-questions?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

I was assuming that when audio data becomes available at the source, the firmware should generate `MESSAGE_MORE_DATA` and the program control should transfer into `aud_inp_handler()`, but it's not happening. I should point out that when I use `StreamConnect()` to connect the source and sink together, but forcefully terminate this connection, the firmware generates a `MESSAGE_STREAM_DISCONNECT` message, which gets captured by the `aud_inp_handler()` function, so the function itself has been registered properly to detect firmware messages, which leads me to believe that audio is not coming from the audio hardware to the audio source buffer in the first place.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How can I set up indirect (managed) connection of source and sink here?   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/610/intel-spi-flash-descriptor&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://meta.iot.stackexchange.com/questions/178/on-topicness-of-embedded-programming-questions?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Every somewhat sophisticated IoT device will communicate via HTTPS making it not too easy to know what it is talking about, even if you do have a not compromised internet gateway in your router.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately you can't know which end points the IoT device is supposed to talk to and which not.

If you set up your own security gateway with filter criteria of blacklisting or whitelisting you might seriously impede your device's functionality.

If they are connected to GPIO pins of the controller, a custom firmware could enable you to switch them of or even use PWM to dim them down. How to &quot;jailbreak&quot; the system is described [here](https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=66346).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the LEDs cannot be toggled from the system and are hardwired it is still possible to tweak the hardware. The LEDs in question are D8..D11 on the PCB. Opening the case (and voiding the warranty and all) you could try to trace the connections of these LEDs that will eventually lead to some resistors. Removing those resistors and replacing them with higher values will reduce the current and thus the luminous flux.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you cannot find the resistors and just want to disable the LEDs you can simply remove them... or block the lightpath inside the housing (covering the LEDs).

If they are connected to GPIO pins of the controller, a custom firmware could enable you to switch them of or even use PWM to dim them down. How to &quot;jailbreak&quot; the system is described [here](https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=66346).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the LEDs cannot be toggled from the system and are hardwired it is still possible to tweak the hardware. The LEDs in question are D8..D11 on the PCB. Opening the case (and voiding the warranty and all) you could try to trace the connections of these LEDs that will eventually lead to some resistors. Removing those resistors and replacing them with higher values will reduce the current and thus the luminous flux.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you cannot find the resistors and just want to disable the LEDs you can simply remove them... or block the lightpath inside the housing (covering the LEDs). This way the device will at least keep a pristine look from the outside. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![PhilipsHueLEDResistor][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;Source: [OpenWRT](https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=66346)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately, this is not possible to be done from the available pictures only, you'll have to open it and figure it out (you'll need a meter).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/br0sT.jpg" />

Once inside, tampering is often not recorded or noticed, and can occur unimpeded. This is simply not possible when using blockchain.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Blockchain, Gada explains, is “a suitable solution in at least three aspects of IoT, including big data management, security and transparency, as well as facilitation of micro-transactions based on the exchange of services between interconnected smart devices.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This seems like a bold, yet rather vague claim. **How, exactly, would a blockchain system provide such protection to a network of connected devices?** Are the benefits mainly due to the improved transparency of the public blockchain, or are there other benefits too?" />

Firmware verification (when implemented, which is rare) is already solved through digital signatures.

But I have a few questions before I sink a bunch of money into bad ideas or things I don't need. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. The main thing I want to do is to set up some lights that can be turned on and off via voice commands, but my wife and kids can still just use the switch. Thus, I think I want to get a SmartThings hub and some [compatible light switches][1], and then I can turn the lights on and off via Google Home voice commands or manually on the switch. Plus I can add smart outlets, thermostats, and locks in the future. Hue light bulbs look like they would be easier to install, but it doesn't look like they would work well with turning them on and off via a traditional light switch. Am I going to be better off with the SmartThings compatible light switches? Or do Hue light bulbs actually work just fine with traditional light switches?&#xD;&#xA; 2. However, one other things I'd like to do is set up our front outside lights to turn on at sunset and then off at sunrise/sometime in the middle of the night. We currently leave these light switches on all the time and put a [light control][2] in the bulb sockets to turn them off during the day. But those are ugly, like to turn on during the day when they're in the shade, and have no option to turn off in the middle of the night. It looks like Hue light bulbs would be the best thing to use to replace this set up. But if I'm already getting a SmartThings hub from question 1, will that work with Hue light bulbs? Or do I need to get a separate Hue hub?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.smartthings.com/works-with-smartthings/-/filter/categories/switches-and-dimmers&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YWEQQY" />

Text="Currently, Alexa supports [*very limited* customisation](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201971890) of the wake word:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Currently, you can use these wake words:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Alexa&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Echo&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Amazon&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Computer&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The documentation also provides instructions for how to select the wake word:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 1. Open the Alexa app.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2. Open the left navigation panel and then select Settings.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 3. Select your device from the menu.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 4. Scroll down and select Wake Word.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 5. Use the drop-down menu to select a wake word and then select Save. When you change the wake word, the light ring on your device flashes orange briefly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is supported for any Alexa device activated by the wake word, and can be highly useful in situations where you are in range of multiple Echos. For example, if your kitchen and bedroom are close, your bedroom Echo might be activated when you intended to activate your kitchen device. By changing the wake word for one of these devices, you can avoid this problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, as I implied at the start of my answer, you can't choose *any wake word you like*; an [article by The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/10/05/google_why_cant_we_choose_wake_words/) suggests why:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And here's where you get to the nuts and bolts of it: choosing a wake word is a little bit of an art: it needs to be short, but a minimum of three syllables; it needs to be easy to say; it needs to have a fairly consistent pronunciation across all different types of people; and it needs to be uncommonly used.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; You need at least three syllables so the software can catch on that you're explicitly speaking to it and that it's not just picking up the start of an unrelated word or random noise. Imagine if you made the wake-up word &quot;Tom&quot; and said &quot;tomato&quot; next to your gadget – you may confuse the heck out of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Giving consumers the ability to choose their own wake words is a potentially huge headache. Companies would have to effectively guide the choice of a wake word, in a similar way to how we are now constantly told the parameters of the password we must choose: no fewer than six characters; must include a number; can't include the following characters.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hence, you get *some customisation* from Alexa, but you are (wisely) not allowed to choose any wake word, because it's likely to lead to poorer voice recognition and a worse experience overall." />

You can configure your router to pass an HTTP access on a special port (public_ip:12380) to port 80 on your entertainment device (192.168.1.xx:80). This would be OK (and easy) if you have a device running Kodi for example, this had a web remote-control.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, based on your asking the question, I'd say this is probably going to be very hard to set up, even using a NAS which supports a VPN isn't simple. It might be worth investigating if a device like Google-home can implement the link you need." />

The address location of each flash block will&#xD;&#xA;&gt; thus be swapped in the logical memory map of the device. After a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; reset, the built-in flash swap system essentially selects which&#xD;&#xA;&gt; software executes by the location of the flash block in the logical&#xD;&#xA;&gt; memory map. This allows a code back-up system with the added ease of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; programming. You can execute out of one block while&#xD;&#xA;&gt; erasing/programming the other block. On Kinetis devices, the flash&#xD;&#xA;&gt; swap system monitors/controls all the steps of switching from the old&#xD;&#xA;&gt; application to new; there is an added assurance of reliable operation&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in the case of a power loss during one of those steps.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Advantages &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Ease of programming.

[This issue](https://github.com/emqtt/emqttd/issues/827) on their bug tracker says:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  *I am facing the issue to store persistent client sessions after broker restart. Does this feature currently not present in the broker or I missing some configuration?*&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; The broker will not persist sessions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, after digging through a couple more issues, I found [this report](https://github.com/emqtt/emqttd/issues/726):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Initially I have set the max clients to 1000K in emqttd.config. Our machine has 8 GB memory with 4 core, I am able to connect 120K concurrent connection easily but when it exceeds 8 GB memory emqttd terminates itself. What I thought is set a max client per machine would be far better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Essentially, as of v2.0.5:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Messages do not seem to be persisted to a file.&#xD;&#xA;- Once the broker runs out of memory, it will simply crash.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not exactly ideal, but that seems to be the current behaviour, so if persisting messages is critical to your use-case, use a different broker.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Here are some more general thoughts/philosophies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. **A DMZ is your friend** - In almost every case where you have a service facing an external network a DMZ (see a.) will be very beneficial. In this case it will both minimize the attack surface and minimize the damage. By limiting the number of devices in the DMZ to only the ones that need external access you limit the attack surface. Also the DMZ will make it much harder for anyone to access your core network, thus minimizing the damage.&#xD;&#xA; 2. **Whitelist, don't Blacklist** - By default every single protocol, port and internal connection should be blocked by default. This blocking should be setup in the device (if possible), the firewall and the router. Only enable options that you are actively using and only for the devices that need one. If you know and must use a protocol for an IoT device that is weak (for example devices that are affected by Mirai) you should setup a device (like a RaspberryPi) to act as relay. You completely isolate the device from the network and only communicate with it via a secure protocol (ssh, vpn etc.) that the RaspberryPi transforms into the protocol that the device needs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [About DMZ from Security.SE][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/3667/what-is-the-real-function-and-use-of-a-dmz-on-a-network" />

So this will only act as a **master**, that have data logging capabilities as well beside the GPRS capability.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus, I am planning to implement **slave** boards without the SIM808 modules. So instead of the SIM808, a simple wireless communication unit is needed to enable local, wireless communication between the hives.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The master would query all the slaves for their data, and then it would  transfer everything via GPRS.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It should look like this, only with a hundred hives:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now **the possibilities** for local wireless communication:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Bluetooth, as I said the master device already have Bluetooth 3.0. But I am not entirely sure that Bluetooth is the right way to query a hundred slave for 1 kBs of data.&#xD;&#xA; 2. The master device has an I2C bus, so I can connect I2C compatible ZigBee or other RF module which could be added to the slave boards as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Collectable data from slaves won't exceed 1 kB/query.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So all in all can I stay at Bluetooth or should I add ZigBee for example to my devices or are there any other options?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Some more details:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- range is max 30 meters&#xD;&#xA;- also as the devices are battery powered, a solution with low power consumption would be good&#xD;&#xA;- the master would run a query in every 15 mins&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The main goal is to make the master able** to query the slaves efficiently, and this should be done **without modifying the PCB of the master**. Thus the two possibilities are Bluetooth 3.0 which is already available for the master or other technologies that I can connect to the master board via the I2C bus of the on-board MCU. (I do not insist on using Bluetooth, it was only the starting point as I already have BT 3.0 by the SIM808.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [![enter image description here][3]][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://simcom.ee/modules/gsm-gprs-gnss/sim808/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q4gFU.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/HPteD.png" />

Text="The WiFi we know and use now also share the 2.4 GHz frequency range with a lot of other technologies and applications which might interfere. If we have a look on the [list of 2.4 GHz radio usage][1], a couple of items are there beside WiFi.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Many cordless telephones and baby monitors in the United States and Canada use the 2.4GHz frequency, the same frequency at which Wi-Fi standards 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n operate.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Bluetooth devices intended for use in short-range personal area networks operate from 2.4 to 2.4835 GHz.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Certain car manufacturers use the 2.4 GHz frequency for their car alarm internal movement sensors. These devices transmit on 2.45 GHz (between channels 8 and 9) at a strength of 500 mW.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - ZigBee&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - My wireless mouse and keyboard.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moreover the 2.4 GHz band has the following [licensed users][2]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; FIXED, MOBILE, RADIOLOCATION, Amateur &amp; Amateur-satellite service&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So accepting interference is pretty much the case right now too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From an [article][3]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It'll be in the 900MHz range, which has better reach and penetration than the 2.4GHz and 5GHz range that existing Wi-Fi operates in. (But, like existing Wi-Fi, it'll be in operating in unlicensed spectrum, so there may be interferences.) There does, of course, have to be a downside. And there is: HaLow isn't going to be as good at quickly transferring data. **This isn't Wi-Fi for browsing the web; it's for transferring small bits of data on infrequent occasions**. Device manufacturers can, to some extent, customize HaLow to their needs to get faster transfers, but that'll happen at the expense of battery life.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So as WiFi HaLow is designed for lower bandwidth and for battry saving low-power applications it might a be better solution if we are already talking about interference.

Further assuming that the the smart lock itself is secure for the moment we can concentrate on the trigger.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Triggering a smart lock with a voice assistant&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Generally there are three options to verify that only an authorized person can open the door. Those are called authentication factors, either the person ***knows*** something, the person ***has*** something or the person ***is*** someone. Those can be combined into *two-factor*, *three-factor* or even more-factor authentications. The corresponding [Wikipedia page][1] is an interesting read about those. The voice assistants currently are unable to discern between voices.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That inability excludes possibility three, identifying you ***being*** you outside your door. On its own, it's obviously unable to check you for ***having*** something specific too. That leaves one authentication factor, you ***knowing*** something.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus, you'll have to configure Google Home or SmartThings or the smart lock to not react to generic commands, but only to specific ones you set. The simplest thing would be renaming your smart lock device. It would leave you for example with the command, *Ok, Google, open the hidden kingdom.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As with every authentication that is based on ***knowing*** something, which is essentially a password, or in this case more aptly a passphrase, the usual rules apply. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Change it from the default value&#xD;&#xA; - Change it regularly&#xD;&#xA; - Make the passphrases hard to guess (and easy to remember)&#xD;&#xA; - Don't tell anyone unauthorized&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since you literally have to say that passphrase in semi-public with passing neighbors, in front of guests and in easy reach of malicious listeners you'd optimally never use a passphrase twice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is why I haven't provided any actual configuration possibilities. Without adding another factor to the voice activated smart lock this is just a truly insecure idea.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Possible second factors could be a face-recognition camera being activated by voice which verifies your identity and opens the lock or a proximity check for your smart phone. Thus, adding factor ***being*** someone or ***having*** something to the really weak ***knowing***.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;1 citation needed&lt;/sub&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication#Factors_and_identity" />

The board itself implements a battery management system, capable of performing weight, humidity and temperature measurements and also can detect device displacements. All collected data is transferred by GPRS connection to a remote server.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The device itself can be installed into beehives, but it would not be cost effective to have a SIM card for hundreds of hives. So this will only act as a **master**, that have data logging capabilities as well beside the GPRS capability.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus, I am planning to implement **slave** boards without the SIM808 modules. So instead of the SIM808, a simple wireless communication unit is needed to enable local, wireless communication between the hives.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The master would query all the slaves for their data, and then it would  transfer everything via GPRS.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It should look like this, only with a hundred hives:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now **the possibilities** for local wireless communication:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1.

In terms of security, AES is a safe bet:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ### Best public cryptanalysis&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Attacks have been published that are computationally faster than a full brute force attack, though none as of 2013 are computationally feasible.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ***- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The paper [*Biclique Cryptanalysis of the Full AES*](http://www.webcitation.org/68GTcKdoD?url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/cryptanalysis/aesbc.pdf) describes that AES-128 requires 2&lt;sup&gt;126.1&lt;/sup&gt; operations, AES-192 requires 2&lt;sup&gt;189.7&lt;/sup&gt; operations, and AES-256 requires 2&lt;sup&gt;254.4&lt;/sup&gt; operations to break. On a 2.9 GHz processor, assuming each 'operation' is 1 CPU cycle (probably not true), breaking AES-128 would take [**a very long time**][1]. With 10 000 of them running, it will still take [nearly forever][2]. So, security isn't a concern here; let's consider the power aspect.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[This paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8fba/0a5577f70b5dacbf322ce0e248cb5ad1b615.pdf) shows (on page 15) that encrypting a block with AES used 351 pJ. I'll compare this a little later after talking about some other common algorithms.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## SIMON&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I asked a question about [SIMON and SPECK](http://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/230/what-exactly-makes-speck-and-simon-particularly-suitable-for-iot-devices) previously, which is worth a read. Where SIMON excels is in situations where you need to encrypt **a little bit of data, frequently**. The paper I linked earlier states that SIMON 64/96 uses 213 pJ for 64 bits, which is practical when you only need to send 32 bits of payload.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;SIMON 64/96 is [significantly easier to break](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/526.pdf) than AES though; the paper I linked suggests a 2&lt;sup&gt;63.9&lt;/sup&gt; operations, so our 10 000 CPU setup *could* crack the encryption [in only a few years](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(2%5E63.9)%2F(2.9*1000000*10000)+seconds+to+days), as opposed to millions of millennia.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Does it really matter?&#xD;&#xA;At the rate you plan to transmit, the answer is almost certainly **no**; the energy usage from cryptography will be entirely negligible. For AES, [you would use 50 544 pJ per day][3], so a [cheap carbon-zinc AA battery](http://www.allaboutbatteries.com/Energy-tables.html) with 2340 J of energy would last [far beyond the device's lifetime][4]. If you re-evaluate the calculations with SIMON, you find that it [also has a **very** long lifetime][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**In short, unless you're transmitting *very* frequently, the radio is far more of a concern for power**. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_low_energy) quotes the power usage as between 0.01 and 0.5 W. If you transmit for **1 second at 0.01 W**, [you've already used more power than AES did over the whole day][6].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1]: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(2%5E126.1)%2F(2.9*1000000)+seconds+to+days&#xD;&#xA;[2]: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(2%5E126.1)%2F(2.9*1000000*10000)+seconds+to+days&#xD;&#xA;[3]: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(351+pJ+%2F+10+minutes)+to+pJ%2Fday&#xD;&#xA;[4]: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2340J+%2F+((351+pJ+%2F+10+minutes)+to+pJ%2Fday)&#xD;&#xA;[5]: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2340J+%2F+((213+pJ+%2F+10+minutes)+to+pJ%2Fday)&#xD;&#xA;[6]: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.01W+*+1+second+%3E+(((213+pJ+%2F+10+minutes)+to+pJ%2Fday)+*+1+day)" />

In terms of security, AES is a safe bet:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ### Best public cryptanalysis&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Attacks have been published that are computationally faster than a full brute force attack, though none as of 2013 are computationally feasible.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ***- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The paper [*Biclique Cryptanalysis of the Full AES*](http://www.webcitation.org/68GTcKdoD?url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/cryptanalysis/aesbc.pdf) describes that AES-128 requires 2&lt;sup&gt;126.1&lt;/sup&gt; operations, AES-192 requires 2&lt;sup&gt;189.7&lt;/sup&gt; operations, and AES-256 requires 2&lt;sup&gt;254.4&lt;/sup&gt; operations to break. On a 2.9 GHz processor, assuming each 'operation' is 1 CPU cycle (probably not true), breaking AES-128 would take [**a very long time**][1]. With 10 000 of them running, it will still take [nearly forever][2]. So, security isn't a concern here; let's consider the power aspect.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[This paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8fba/0a5577f70b5dacbf322ce0e248cb5ad1b615.pdf) shows (on page 15) that encrypting a block with AES used 351 pJ. I'll compare this a little later after talking about some other common algorithms.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## SIMON&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I asked a question about [SIMON and SPECK](http://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/230/what-exactly-makes-speck-and-simon-particularly-suitable-for-iot-devices) previously, which is worth a read. Where SIMON excels is in situations where you need to encrypt **a little bit of data, frequently**. The paper I linked earlier states that SIMON 64/96 uses 213 pJ for 64 bits, which is practical when you only need to send 32 bits of payload.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;SIMON 64/96 is [significantly easier to break](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/526.pdf) than AES though; the paper I linked suggests a 2&lt;sup&gt;63.9&lt;/sup&gt; operations, so our 10 000 CPU setup *could* crack the encryption [in only a few years](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(2%5E63.9)%2F(2.9*1000000*10000)+seconds+to+days), as opposed to millions of millennia.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Does it really matter?&#xD;&#xA;At the rate you plan to transmit, the answer is almost certainly **no**; the energy usage from cryptography will be entirely negligible. For AES, [you would use 50 544 pJ per day][3], so a [cheap carbon-zinc AA battery](http://www.allaboutbatteries.com/Energy-tables.html) with 2340 J of energy would last [far beyond the device's lifetime][4]. If you re-evaluate the calculations with SIMON, you find that it [also has a **very** long lifetime][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**In short, unless you're transmitting *very* frequently, the radio is far more of a concern for power**. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_low_energy) quotes the power usage as between 0.01 and 0.5 W. If you transmit for **1 second at 0.01 W**, [you've already used more power than AES did over the whole day][6].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For BLE, though, you're probably fine just relying on the default security; [BLE uses AES-CCM by default for link-layer security](https://www.bluetooth.com/~/media/files/specification/bluetooth-low-energy-security.ashx?la=en):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Encryption in Bluetooth with low energy uses AES-CCM cryptography. Like BR/EDR, the LE Controller will&#xD;&#xA;perform the encryption function. This function generates 128-bit encryptedData from a 128-bit key and&#xD;&#xA;128-bit plaintextData using the AES-128-bit block cypher as defined in FIPS-1971.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is [some concern](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/100443/security-of-bluetooth-low-energy-ble-link-layer-encryption) that there are security flaws with BLE's implementation of the link-layer security though; **this is not a flaw in AES; rather Bluetooth SIG decided to roll their own key exchange mechanism in 4.0 and 4.1**. The issue is now resolved in 4.2 as the Elliptical Curve Hellman-Diffie is now supported.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1]: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(2%5E126.1)%2F(2.9*1000000)+seconds+to+days&#xD;&#xA;[2]: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(2%5E126.1)%2F(2.9*1000000*10000)+seconds+to+days&#xD;&#xA;[3]: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(351+pJ+%2F+10+minutes)+to+pJ%2Fday&#xD;&#xA;[4]: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2340J+%2F+((351+pJ+%2F+10+minutes)+to+pJ%2Fday)&#xD;&#xA;[5]: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2340J+%2F+((213+pJ+%2F+10+minutes)+to+pJ%2Fday)&#xD;&#xA;[6]: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.01W+*+1+second+%3E+(((213+pJ+%2F+10+minutes)+to+pJ%2Fday)+*+1+day)" />

That means if you take a naive approach, like using AES in CBC mode, you risk increasing the message size to carry the extra bits in each block.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you determine your business needs the data to be encrypted, consider using AES in [CTR][1] mode to generate stream cypher bits.  Counter mode is practical for dealing with cases where reception can be unreliable and packets may be lost.  You'll have to keep the counters synchronized, so be aware that periodically transmitting the counter's value will add to the overhead.

To add support for muting the microphone would tie Alexa much closer in to the wake word initiated devices, which could be problematic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition, supporting mute-by-voice could lead to frustrating accidents where Alexa *thought* you said &quot;mute the microphone&quot;, forcing you to **get up and unmute it, because it now can't respond to you after being muted**." />

Device manufacturers can, to some extent, customize HaLow to their needs to get faster transfers, but that'll happen at the expense of battery life.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So as WiFi HaLow is designed for lower bandwidth and for battry saving low-power applications it might a be better solution if we are already talking about interference.

At 50A switched ~= 5.5 kW load the 5 Watts (or less) dissipation can be accommodated using standard mounting methods.  . &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[**This Digikey product page**](http://www.digikey.com/products/en/relays/power-relays-over-2-amps/188?FV=fff40010%2Cfff80367%2C16080001%2C1608000e%2C1608000f%2C16080010%2C16080011%2C16080012%2C16080014%2C16080015%2C16080016%2C16080019%2C1608001c%2C1608001d%2C16080003%2C16080020%2C16080021%2C16080023%2C16080025%2C16080028%2C16080037%2C1608003b%2C16080006%2C1608003c%2C1608003d%2C1608003e%2C16080044%2C16080046%2C16080047%2C16080049%2C16080009%2C160c006b%2C160c00a5%2C160c002f%2C160c0034%2C160c0038%2C160c003f%2C160c0042%2C160c0050%2C160c0058%2C160c005a%2Cffe000bc&amp;mnonly=0&amp;newproducts=0&amp;ColumnSort=1000011&amp;page=1&amp;stock=1&amp;pbfree=0&amp;rohs=0&amp;k=relay&amp;quantity=&amp;ptm=0&amp;fid=0&amp;pageSize=500&amp;pkeyword=relay) lists literally dozens of relays rated at 30A, &lt;- 265 VAC for under $US10 in unit quantity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The [Panasonic HE series relays](http://www3.panasonic.biz/ac/e_download/control/relay/power/catalog/mech_eng_hepv.pdf?via=ok) in single quantities cost about   &#xD;&#xA;$22 for the [48A, &lt;=277VAC version](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/panasonic-electric-works/HE1AN-P-DC12V-Y5/255-2777-ND/2125685) and   &#xD;&#xA;$33 for the [90A, &lt;=277 VAC version](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/panasonic-electric-works/HE1AN-W-DC24V-Y6/255-5247-ND/5518187)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This relay series is not available with 110VAC coil and was used as an example.

Bucchere was charged with felony vehicular manslaughter, carrying a potential penalty of six years in prison. Prosecutors obtained his data from his GPS-enabled fitness tracker to show he’d been speeding before the accident. Bucchere’s self-monitoring became a piece of evidence against himself due to a lack of privacy. This is not to condone Bucchere — clearly he committed a crime — rather this just illustrates one example of surprising use cases for what you might think is harmless personal data.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Clearly, I would rather not have my GPS location recorded at all times, in case the data gets hacked or given to anyone without my permission.

Sum up your requirements towards the microcontroller. For example in this case:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **1 hardware timer**, to measure time between trigger and echo pulses.&#xD;&#xA; - **2 GPIO pins** to interface the sensor Echo and Trigger pins.&#xD;&#xA; - Possibly **UART** to interface the RF communication module.&#xD;&#xA; - **1 ADC input** to monitor the battery voltage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;You can get along with a 8 pin controller for this, which might requires usage of the programmer pins for general purposes as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Decide the required **CPU performance** and **memory requirements**. Is it enough to use a 8-bit MCU or you a 32-bit one is needed? What CPU clock speeds are acceptable tens of MHz or 1 MHz is enough? How much program memory, RAM and ROM are needed?&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA; Given the described application, you do not need high computing performance probably so a 8-bit controller will suffice (though won't be much cheaper than a 32-bit one so you can decide here by the price maybe).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. **Low power**. When it is not crucial you can probably get along with almost any kind of controller using its low power mode with the lowest supply voltage and system clock frequency.&#xD;&#xA; If it is more important you can start narrowing down your search list by starting with dedicated low-power MCU cores like (ARM® Cortex®-M0 or M0+ CPU cores). Usually the datasheets contain tables for most of the **low power modes/VCC/SysClk frequency**, better ones will list the consumption of each peripherals as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. **Developer tools**. I consider it as a very important aspect. Dedicated hardware programmer tools can cost fortunes so usually I stick to MCUs I have already have programmers for. When you switch to another family or brand it is good to invest into a development board that has an on-board programmer which could be used later to program your custom boards. In general always check first that how much will it cost to be able to download programs to a microcontroller.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition about how will any MCU survive in the well. It will all comes down on the enclosure you will provide for the device. For example it won't matter much which MCU you choose if the enclosure is not 100% water resistant.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;TL;DR; Here comes the product specific part.&#xD;&#xA;--------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. You can choose the [ATtiny25][1] which costs [0.87$/1 piece][2] on Farnell. 8-bit, 8-pin, you should run at 1 MHz, won't take much space. In Idle mode it consumes 0.25 mA at 1 MHz VCC: 3 V (note that: it is quite a lot of current).

Alexa hasn’t supported the ability to provide any kind of audio notice unprompted as a result of data it receives from a user’s connected services – the closest it comes is being able to sound an alert based on an alarm or timer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A second citation comes from [Consumerist](https://consumerist.com/2016/09/12/amazons-alexa-may-get-the-ability-to-talk-without-being-spoken-to-first/):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;As it stands right now, Amazon Echo is the well-behaved child your grandparents might have approved of: it doesn’t speak until spoken to. But soon Alexa could be piping up to offer information without being prompted first.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for creating a skill that would allow Alexa to speak without a trigger, [Amazon documentation](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/developing-an-alexa-skill-as-a-lambda-function) seems to indicate that an essential part of setting up a skill is implementing an audio trigger.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So as far as I can see, the answer is, **No.**" />

Sum up your requirements towards the microcontroller. For example in this case:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **1 hardware timer**, to measure time between trigger and echo pulses.&#xD;&#xA; - **2 GPIO pins** to interface the sensor Echo and Trigger pins.&#xD;&#xA; - Possibly **UART** to interface the RF communication module.&#xD;&#xA; - **1 ADC input** to monitor the battery voltage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;You can get along with a 8 pin controller for this, which might requires usage of the programmer pins for general purposes as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Decide the required **CPU performance** and **memory requirements**. Is it enough to use a 8-bit MCU or you need a 32-bit one instead? What CPU clock speeds are acceptable tens of MHz or 1 MHz is enough? How much program memory, RAM and ROM are needed?&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA; Given the described application, you do not need high computing performance probably so a 8-bit controller will suffice (though won't be much cheaper than a 32-bit one so you can decide here by the price maybe).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. **Low power**. When it is not crucial you can probably get along with almost any kind of controller using its low power mode with the lowest supply voltage and system clock frequency.&#xD;&#xA; If it is more important you can start narrowing down your search list by starting with dedicated low-power MCU cores like (ARM® Cortex®-M0 or M0+ CPU cores). Usually the datasheets contain tables for most of the **low power modes/VCC/SysClk frequency**, better ones will list the consumption of each peripherals as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. **Developer tools**. I consider it as a very important aspect. Dedicated hardware programmer tools can cost fortunes so usually I stick to MCUs I have already had programmers for. When you switch to another family or brand it is good to invest into a development board that has an on-board programmer which could be used later to program your custom boards. In general always check first that how much will it cost to be able to download programs to a microcontroller.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As @Sean has pointed out in the comments, a possible and cost effective solution would be to search for such RF modules that comes with an integrated, programmable application MCU, which can run your firmware while handling the RF communication part as well. Such modules exists for BLE, WiFi and ZigBee and possibly for many other technologies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition about how will any MCU survive in the well. It will all comes down on the enclosure you will provide for the device. For example it won't matter much which MCU you choose if the enclosure is not 100% water resistant.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;TL;DR; Here comes the product specific part.&#xD;&#xA;--------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. You can choose the [ATtiny25][1] which costs [0.87$/1 piece][2] on Farnell. 8-bit, 8-pin so won't take much space. In Power-down mode it consumes 0.2 μA with disabled watchdog, at 3 V. 2-4 μA if the watchdog is enabled.&#xD;&#xA;It is [Arduino compatible][3] so programming it won't cost you much (USBasp or AVRdude programmer costs about 2$ on eBay). (**Note that**: you should use Arduino Software Serial library to interface an RF communication module, as this MCU only has SPI by hardware.) All in all small, small, cheap, small, relatively high consumption, **bit-banged UART so might be complicated**. It has 2 kB program memory which should be enough for you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Or go with an ARM Cortex M0, which consumes 2 μA in Standby mode and 5 μA in Stop mode, much less than the ATtiny. Such MCU is for example [STM32F030F4][4] which costs [1.09$/1 piece][5]. It is a more powerful 32-bit controller with a maximum of 48 MHz system clock frequency, but as you can see only for +0.2$. It comes with 16 kB program memory, far than enough for this simple task. It has SPI, UART, I2C and plenty other peripherals.&#xD;&#xA; Programming it will costs more, [dedicated programmer][6] costs 20$ at Farnell. **In my opinion, not worth it. Instead you can invest in a development board for the F0 family which has an on-board programmer (ST-LINK)**. [STM32F0Discovery][7] board costs [~10$][8]. You can start prototyping with this board and use it as a programmer later.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.atmel.com/images/atmel-2586-avr-8-bit-microcontroller-attiny25-attiny45-attiny85_datasheet.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.newark.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Search?catalogId=15003&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=10194&amp;sort=P_PRICE&amp;eq=N%3D422%2B2203%26amp%3BNtk%3Ddesc_pn%26amp%3BNtt%3DAttiny25%26amp%3BNtx%3Drel%2Bgensearch_store_specific%252cstatic%2528P_STORE_MARKETING_RANK_NEWARK_US%252cascending%2529%2Bmode%2Bmatchpartialmax%26amp%3BNty%3D1%26amp%3BNtpc%3D1%26amp%3BNtpr%3D1%26amp%3BD%3DAttiny25*%26amp%3BDn%3D2203%2B2203%26amp%3BDx%3Dmode%2Bmatchall&amp;st=Attiny25&amp;selectedCategoryId=%5BLjava.lang.String%3B%403fb43fb4&amp;showResults=true&amp;aa=true&amp;vw=&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://github.com/damellis/attiny/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/datasheet/a4/5d/0b/0e/87/c4/4d/71/DM00088500.pdf/files/DM00088500.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.DM00088500.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.newark.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Search?catalogId=15003&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=10194&amp;sort=P_PRICE&amp;eq=N%3D422%2B2203%26amp%3BNtk%3Ddesc_pn%26amp%3BNtt%3DSTM32F030F4%26amp%3BNtx%3Drel%2Bgensearch_store_specific%252cstatic%2528P_STORE_MARKETING_RANK_NEWARK_US%252cascending%2529%2Bmode%2Bmatchpartialmax%26amp%3BNty%3D1%26amp%3BNtpc%3D1%26amp%3BNtpr%3D1%26amp%3BD%3DSTM32F030F4*%26amp%3BDn%3D2203%2B2203%26amp%3BDx%3Dmode%2Bmatchall&amp;st=STM32F030F4&amp;selectedCategoryId=%5BLjava.lang.String%3B%406cc06cc0&amp;showResults=true&amp;aa=true&amp;vw=&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://www.newark.com/stmicroelectronics/st-link-v2/icd-programmer-for-stm8-stm32/dp/46T6935?ost=STM32&amp;categoryId=800000004034&amp;searchView=table&amp;iscrfnonsku=false&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f0discovery.html&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: https://www.arrow.com/en/products/stm32f0discovery/stmicroelectronics?gclid=CMH344ih4NECFRVuGwodRvEA9g" />

Even with network address translation (NAT) and private address space, the IoT’s appetite for addresses will overcome IPv4’s ability to sate it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Enter IPv6, which expands the address space to 340 undecillion, or 3.4×1038. Well, it’s technically a bit less than that, since some combinations are reserved; nonetheless, that’s still enough usable addresses to allocate about 4,000 to every person on the planet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What puzzles me is why the Internet of Things would make any difference to the need to switch to IPV6.

As more and more people come online, we're starting to reach the point where IPs have to be shared across multiple people, not just one household ([carrier-grade NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT)), which is unacceptable, and not just a problem for IoT.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;IPv6 allows us to move to a more *semantic* representation where **one IP = one device**, which has several advantages. If you're directly able to address your smart device (be it a toaster, oven, lightbulb, TV, or something else), you can just send your commands **directly to the device**, rather than needing to go through a hub. At the moment, NAT makes this difficult to set up, because it requires specifically port forwarding your IoT devices (and this may not work at all for carrier-grade NAT).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It might be worth reading ['Switching to IPv6 implies dropping NAT. Is that a good thing?'](http://serverfault.com/questions/184524/switching-to-ipv6-implies-dropping-nat-is-that-a-good-thing) from Server Fault if you're worried about the security implication; having all your IoT devices given a public IPv6 address is not really a big security flaw; it's something that would still cause a problem on a NAT-enabled network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[This IEEE article](http://iot.ieee.org/newsletter/july-2015/the-case-for-ipv6-as-an-enabler-of-the-internet-of-things.html) has some good points:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The next logical step from networks of mobile devices to networks of communicating &quot;Things&quot; is IoT. That next step will mirror the sequence of events experienced by mobile networks. Proprietary protocols came first, because an individual company’s profits often come before consideration of the common good. But the use of IP and transparency (i.e., open source protocols) is fundamental to IoT development, just as the ease of use and the invisibility of the technology is important to end users. Our view, based on our research, is that the value of transparency and ease-of-use, and even more importantly the need for interoperability, will favor IPv6 adoption by the IoT market.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, in short:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- At the moment, 1 IPv4 address represents... *who knows?* Sometimes a device, sometimes a router, sometimes a whole network of different customers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Using an IPv6 lets you give each IoT device a 'name' on the Internet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Being able to address your devices lets you control them, and simplifies setup and management." />

If both source and destination have public IPv4 (or IPv6, of course) address, they can connect to each other in any direction anytime.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your IoT with private IP `192.168.0.52` however can use [NAT][1] ONLY to connect to any public IP on the Internet whenever it wants, but the rest of the Internet cannot connect to it. There were kludges like [DNAT][2] and [uPNP][3] that used to allowed you to specify that some incoming connection are enabled, but they are breaking more and more nowdays due to implementation of [CGNAT][4] because of IPv4 shortages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Common (so-called) &quot;solution&quot; to this problem is that all your (NATed) devices connect to come central location with public IP (usually manufacturer of device).

Text="I suggest a step by step approach to find out what language and controller you should use. The microcontroller you need will depend on the tasks you want it to do. Theoretically the task will set up some requirements that an appropriate microcontroller will fulfill, so you should choose the microcontroller by these requirements.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Define a user story for the device. What do you expect from it? What do you want it to be capable of?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; In your case it is already defined by you:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; A battery powered device that should be capable of receiving inputs from a smart-phone and display weather information of requested locations on its own display.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Now step 1. gives you something to start with. You can decide what hardware you need on a block diagram level. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  You will certainly need a display and possibly a WiFi or Bluetooth module to communicate with your mobile. Accessing global weather databases will possibly require Internet connection. You should control both of these with an MCU or the WiFi module (you need Internet so you can exclude Bluetooth) should be able to control the display and run your software.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. You can start looking for specific parts. You can start with deciding what battery you will use, so you can take into consideration the power consumption of your potential parts. I have summed a general process for selecting MCUs in one of my [previous answer][1]. Basically the same should be done here. Find a cheap display, it will probably use an SPI or I2C interface for communication. Then you can search for either a Wifi module with SPI/I2C and has an integrated MCU or a separate MCU and a WiFi module. The individual WiFi module will probably use UART to communicate so the individual MCU should have that along the SPI/I2C.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. As for the language. Most microcontroller will limit your possibilities in this field. In most cases your choices will be either C, C++ or Assembly, strictly speaking of microcontrollers here and not single board computers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; If you decide to go with a BeagleBone or Raspberry which can run Linux or other powerful OS then I say that the best language will be the one that you know the best, of course it should be able to handle the task. ([You can run Java on the RPi if you like.][2])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Opening a socket to a global weather data service can be done in C, C# or Python as well. Would be a bit more difficult to process JSON with C but certainly possible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Speaking about costs in general. The best option is to search for WiFi enabled display devices, there will be a lot of results and most of them will use the same hardware, and probably this will be the cheapest.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You could use an [ESP8266][3] WiFi module which is Arduino compatible to connect to the internet and interface a display. It will require much tinkering than a Raspberry Pi would but will be cheaper.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here is a [Hackaday project about ESP8266 + OLED display][4].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://iot.stackexchange.com/a/881/14&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://pi4j.com/example/control.html&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://hackaday.io/project/10034-esp8266-oled-display" />

If both source and destination have public IPv4 (or IPv6, of course) address, they can connect to each other in any direction anytime.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your IoT with private IP `192.168.0.52` however can use [NAT][1] ONLY to connect to any public IP on the Internet whenever it wants, but the rest of the Internet cannot connect to it. There were kludges like [DNAT][2] and [uPNP][3] that used to allowed you to specify that some incoming connections are enabled, but they are breaking more and more nowadays due to implementation of [CGNAT][4] because of IPv4 shortages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A common (so-called) &quot;solution&quot; to this problem is that all your (NATed) devices connect to some central location with public IP (usually hosted by the manufacturer of device).

That claim may not quite be true (see the vocore2 below, for example) but in my experience it's got to be in the smallest 3. Costs only $5, built-in wifi, designed with IoT specifically in mind. Has a few shields available on [their web site](https://onion.io/). Brand new product, seems to have a strong and active community. Kickstarter backers get the device. Worth checking out. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, as pointed out in comments, check out the [vocore2](https://igg.me/at/vocore2/x/277351), which actually seems to be smaller than the Onion, and cheaper at $4. It's currently being funded at IndieGoGo and estimated shipping dates are February 2017 (next month at the time of this writing). Also looks to have an assortment of docks available, and has a built-in wifi router, which is kinda cool.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I just came across those the other day and have no experience with them. Note, however, due to their newness, some of the Linux packages you may be used to using may not be available *yet* (for example, I know for a fact that at the time of this writing a gstreamer package is not available on the Onion yet, you have to build from source, although gstreamer is not relevant for you).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Short of those, like the other answer says, the Pi is a great low cost device. [Don't forget the Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/), another tiny $5 computer along the lines of the Onion. It doesn't have all the ports on board that the larger Pi's have but if you don't mind, or if you just want to use a 3 for development and a Zero for its size in final products, it's another choice worth considering.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other devices, some expensive, include:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [BeagleBone Black](http://beagleboard.org/bone) (this is the only Pi alternative I'd seriously consider because of its low cost).&#xD;&#xA;- [Gumstix](https://www.gumstix.com/) ($$$, but we use these all the time in projects for their size)&#xD;&#xA;- [Udoo](http://www.udoo.org/) ($$$ but packs a punch)&#xD;&#xA;- [Toradex Colibri](https://www.toradex.com/computer-on-modules/colibri-arm-family) (A bit hard to work with but we use these a lot, too, better specs than a Gumstix, and have the option of running Windows CE with an instant boot feature if you'd prefer a Windows toolchain and virtually zero boot time).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also note that [Vilros makes some *awesome* Pi starter kits](http://www.vilros.com/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-kits.html) (cheaper on Amazon) pre-packaged with an OS, working Wifi, heat sinks, a case, works right out of the box and saves a ton of grunt setup work. Also worth checking out if you go the Pi route. Vilros also used to make Beaglebone starter kits, which no longer seem to be available on their site but if you search Newegg/Amazon/etc. you can still find available stock.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By the way, an Arduino (or another microcontroller, contrast with the full-blown single-board computers listed above) on its own probably *isn't* what you want here. The Arduino is just an Atmel ATmega168/328. It does not run an OS and doesn't really do anything besides precisely what you tell it to do. So for example, for networking you'd need the ethernet shield, which ships with a full ethernet control library that I believe provides a TCP and UDP stack (I've never used it, just browsing their site) and of course takes up a lot of limited code space. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then you'd have to build your weather client and everything on top of that, and you've got to do it all in 32KB or less. It's a different flavor of development than doing Linux/Windows development on the Pi/Beaglebone/Gumstix/Colibri/etc. A bit outside the scope of this answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What the Arduino *is* good for here is as an add-on to your main system to do hardware interface stuff, like read pressure sensors, buttons, control basic electronic elements, that kind of thing. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Embedded systems development is a whole different beast than the desktop development you'd be doing on the Pi, and I really wouldn't recommend trying to do this with an Arduino alone, especially without experience.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

You may need a small amount of extra circuitry depending on the required coil voltage. If you use a relay with a mains-voltage AC coil you need only the relay plus an enclosure and whatever is required for connections. Note that solid state switches (SSRs) are both far more costly than 'old fashioned' relays, and inferior in energy losses. SSR2 typically drop 2 to 3 VAC across the operating relay. At 50A that would dissipate Power = V x I = 2V x 50A = 100 Watts (or 150W at 3V). This level of thermal energy requires heat sinking.  A mechanical relay such as the 90A Panasonic one listed below has a contact resistance of under 2 milliOhm worst case at end of lifetime for a energy loss at 50A of I^2 x R = 5 Watts (or 16 Watts at 90A).

In some applications dedicated  contactors such as the &quot;Functional Devices&quot; and &quot;Packard&quot; ones that Harper suggested may be good - but I'd want a far better specification sheet than in the links and rather more certainty of the quality regardless of volume sold. Such relays may be excellent - but know why you think any brand is and be sure that both the specifications AND the real world performance do in fact meet the application. Ideally buy through a known reputable supplier who guarantees &quot;provenance&quot;. ebay and &quot;even&quot; Alibaba can be a source some very well priced high quality products. But also some extremely shonky ones indeed. If you are able to assess quality and legitimacy of certifications yourself they can be a good idea.

The other thing Mirai does is to block ports to avoid monitoring tools to detect it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These two features can be looked for. The first needs a very sophisticated network traffic monitoring solution and intricate knowledge about what kind of traffic you expect in your network. If your IoT device does not communicate via a WiFi connection but over 3G or other mobile telecommunication standards you are pretty much out of luck because you cannot monitor those. At least not easily and in most jurisdictions not legally.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second Mirai feature is the thing Incapsula also scans for. If the ports are closed there is a *possible* Mirai infection. Since rebooting temporarily frees the device from Mirai's clutches the change in port availability in the time after a reboot can be taken as a very likely sign that the device has been compromised.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Do keep in mind, that Incapsula does not provide certainty but only gives your information about devices that are possible targets and devices that *might have been* infected. This is why it is important to realize that the Mirai however powerful attacks it can field it is not an unbeatable enemy on a small scope, it's even easy to prevent infections.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The next two sections will show that detecting is way too much effort compared to securing a device in the first place or securing your device on a hunch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Recapturing your device**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, Mirai acts as an end point for a bot net and the worm is not changing the persistent memory of the IoT device. I.e. the firmware is not infected. This is the reason why *a reboot and an immediate password change* gives you back control over your device.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Infected systems can be cleaned by rebooting them, but since scanning for these devices happens at a constant rate, it’s possible for them to be reinfected within minutes of a reboot. This means users have to change the default password immediately after rebooting, or prevent the device from accessing the internet until they can reset the firmware and change the password locally.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Webroot.com: Source Code for Mirai IoT Malware Released][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Prevent being compromised in the first place**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Mirai does not hack your devices!* &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Mirai continuously scans the internet for IoT devices and logs into them using the factory default or hard-coded usernames and passwords.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Webroot.com: Source Code for Mirai IoT Malware Released][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Mirai uses factory default logins to compromise your devices.

There are [61 unique username/password combinations that Mirai is programmed with (these are hard-coded)](https://github.com/jgamblin/Mirai-Source-Code/blob/master/mirai/bot/scanner.c#L124-L185).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. The scanner searches only on a [limited set of subnets to find targets](https://github.com/rosgos/Mirai-Source-Code/blob/master/mirai/bot/scanner.c#L674-L704). These are: 127.0.0.0/8, 0.0.0.0/8, 3.0.0.0/8, 15.0.0.0/7, 56.0.0.0/8, 10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/14 , 100.64.0.0/10, 169.254.0.0/16, 198.18.0.0/15, 224.*.*.*+, {6, 7, 11, 21, 22, 26, 28, 29, 30, 33, 55, 214, 215}.0.0.0/8. I've grouped the last set of blocks because these were all labelled as &quot;Department of Defense&quot; in the comments of the code.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Mirai [performs](https://github.com/rosgos/Mirai-Source-Code/blob/master/mirai/bot/scanner.c#L200-L235) a rather primitive [SYN scan](http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/SYN-scanning) to try and find if any ports are open. If you're not familiar with how SYN scans work, they essentially involve sending a TCP **SYN** packet, which is the normal process of starting a TCP connection. The attacker then waits in hope of receiving a SYN-ACK packet, which would confirm that the target is listening on the specified port. You can read more about the process [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Connection_establishment).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. Any targets that respond with a SYN-ACK are [added to a list of potential victims](https://github.com/rosgos/Mirai-Source-Code/blob/master/mirai/bot/scanner.c#L237-L294).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. Mirai selects a password to try [semi-randomly](https://github.com/rosgos/Mirai-Source-Code/blob/master/mirai/bot/scanner.c#L885-L899), using some sort of weighting system and attempts to [connect using that](https://github.com/rosgos/Mirai-Source-Code/blob/master/mirai/bot/scanner.c#L372).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;6. Mirai then [monitors to check if its connection was successful](https://github.com/rosgos/Mirai-Source-Code/blob/master/mirai/bot/scanner.c#L449)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;7. If the connection times out or something goes wrong, [Mirai retries for a maximum of 10 attempts](https://github.com/rosgos/Mirai-Source-Code/blob/master/mirai/bot/scanner.c#L317).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;8. If all of this succeeds, tough luck. Your device is now **infected** until it restarts!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, in summary, to answer your question, **yes, the version of Mirai known publicly will be defeated if you change the username and password**. Anyone who modified their copy of Mirai could have added additional attack vectors though, although you might not class that as the same malware type any more." />

Sum up your requirements towards the microcontroller. For example in this case:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **1 hardware timer**, to measure time between trigger and echo pulses.&#xD;&#xA; - **2 GPIO pins** to interface the sensor Echo and Trigger pins.&#xD;&#xA; - Possibly **UART** to interface the RF communication module.&#xD;&#xA; - **1 ADC input** to monitor the battery voltage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;You can get along with a 8 pin controller for this, which might requires usage of the programmer pins for general purposes as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Decide the required **CPU performance** and **memory requirements**. Is it enough to use a 8-bit MCU or you need a 32-bit one instead? What CPU clock speeds are acceptable tens of MHz or 1 MHz is enough? How much program memory, RAM and ROM are needed?&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA; Given the described application, you do not need high computing performance. Probably a 8-bit controller will suffice (though won't be much cheaper than a 32-bit one so you can decide here by the price maybe).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. **Low power**. When it is not crucial you can probably get along with almost any kind of controller using its low power mode with the lowest supply voltage and system clock frequency.&#xD;&#xA; If it is more important you can start narrowing down your search list by starting with dedicated low-power MCU cores like (ARM® Cortex®-M0 or M0+ CPU cores). Usually the datasheets contain tables for most of the **low power modes/VCC/SysClk frequency**, better ones will list the consumption of each peripherals as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. **Developer tools**. I consider it as a very important aspect. Dedicated hardware programmer tools can cost fortunes so usually I stick to MCUs I have already had programmers for. When you switch to another family or brand it is good to invest into a development board that has an on-board programmer which could be used later to program your custom boards. In general always check first that how much will it cost to be able to download programs to a microcontroller.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As @Sean has pointed out in the comments, a possible and cost effective solution would be to search for such RF modules that comes with an integrated, programmable application MCU, which can run your firmware while handling the RF communication part as well. Such modules exists for BLE, WiFi and ZigBee and possibly for many other technologies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition about how will any MCU survive in the well. It will all comes down on the enclosure you will provide for the device. For example it won't matter much which MCU you choose if the enclosure is not 100% water resistant.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;TL;DR; Here comes the product specific part.&#xD;&#xA;--------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. You can choose the [ATtiny25][1] which costs [0.87$/1 piece][2] on Farnell. 8-bit, 8-pin so won't take much space. In Power-down mode it consumes 0.2 μA with disabled watchdog, at 3 V. 2-4 μA if the watchdog is enabled.&#xD;&#xA;It is [Arduino compatible][3] so programming it won't cost you much (USBasp or AVRdude programmer costs about 2$ on eBay). (**Note that**: you should use Arduino Software Serial library to interface an RF communication module, as this MCU only has SPI by hardware.) All in all small, small, cheap, small, relatively high consumption, **bit-banged UART so might be complicated**. It has 2 kB program memory which should be enough for you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Or go with an ARM Cortex M0, which consumes 2 μA in Standby mode and 5 μA in Stop mode, much less than the ATtiny. Such MCU is for example [STM32F030F4][4] which costs [1.09$/1 piece][5]. It is a more powerful 32-bit controller with a maximum of 48 MHz system clock frequency, but as you can see only for +0.2$. It comes with 16 kB program memory, far than enough for this simple task. It has SPI, UART, I2C and plenty other peripherals.&#xD;&#xA; Programming it will costs more, [dedicated programmer][6] costs 20$ at Farnell. **In my opinion, not worth it. Instead you can invest in a development board for the F0 family which has an on-board programmer (ST-LINK)**. [STM32F0Discovery][7] board costs [~10$][8]. You can start prototyping with this board and use it as a programmer later.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.atmel.com/images/atmel-2586-avr-8-bit-microcontroller-attiny25-attiny45-attiny85_datasheet.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.newark.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Search?catalogId=15003&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=10194&amp;sort=P_PRICE&amp;eq=N%3D422%2B2203%26amp%3BNtk%3Ddesc_pn%26amp%3BNtt%3DAttiny25%26amp%3BNtx%3Drel%2Bgensearch_store_specific%252cstatic%2528P_STORE_MARKETING_RANK_NEWARK_US%252cascending%2529%2Bmode%2Bmatchpartialmax%26amp%3BNty%3D1%26amp%3BNtpc%3D1%26amp%3BNtpr%3D1%26amp%3BD%3DAttiny25*%26amp%3BDn%3D2203%2B2203%26amp%3BDx%3Dmode%2Bmatchall&amp;st=Attiny25&amp;selectedCategoryId=%5BLjava.lang.String%3B%403fb43fb4&amp;showResults=true&amp;aa=true&amp;vw=&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://github.com/damellis/attiny/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/datasheet/a4/5d/0b/0e/87/c4/4d/71/DM00088500.pdf/files/DM00088500.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.DM00088500.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.newark.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Search?catalogId=15003&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=10194&amp;sort=P_PRICE&amp;eq=N%3D422%2B2203%26amp%3BNtk%3Ddesc_pn%26amp%3BNtt%3DSTM32F030F4%26amp%3BNtx%3Drel%2Bgensearch_store_specific%252cstatic%2528P_STORE_MARKETING_RANK_NEWARK_US%252cascending%2529%2Bmode%2Bmatchpartialmax%26amp%3BNty%3D1%26amp%3BNtpc%3D1%26amp%3BNtpr%3D1%26amp%3BD%3DSTM32F030F4*%26amp%3BDn%3D2203%2B2203%26amp%3BDx%3Dmode%2Bmatchall&amp;st=STM32F030F4&amp;selectedCategoryId=%5BLjava.lang.String%3B%406cc06cc0&amp;showResults=true&amp;aa=true&amp;vw=&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://www.newark.com/stmicroelectronics/st-link-v2/icd-programmer-for-stm8-stm32/dp/46T6935?ost=STM32&amp;categoryId=800000004034&amp;searchView=table&amp;iscrfnonsku=false&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f0discovery.html&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: https://www.arrow.com/en/products/stm32f0discovery/stmicroelectronics?gclid=CMH344ih4NECFRVuGwodRvEA9g" />

If both source and destination have public IPv4 (or IPv6, of course) address, they can connect to each other in any direction anytime.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your IoT with private IP `192.168.0.52` however can use [NAT][1] ONLY to connect to any public IP on the Internet whenever it wants, but the rest of the Internet cannot connect to it. There were kludges like [DNAT][2] and [uPNP][3] that used to allow you to specify that some incoming connections are enabled, but they are breaking more and more nowadays due to implementation of [CGNAT][4] because of IPv4 shortages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A common (so-called) &quot;solution&quot; to this problem is that all your (NATed) devices connect to some central location with public IP (usually hosted by the manufacturer of device). This makes it work technically, but involves a **privacy** issue (you're giving all the data from your IoTs), **security** issue (as you're wide open to them, breach or disgruntled employee can do anything your IoT device can do and access), and **reliability** issue (when the manufacturer goes out of business or decides to stop supporting old devices or is suffering outages) all your (and everybody elses) perfectly functional devices will stop working.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(2) **second problem is that it will stop working anyway** (even for outgoing connections) some time in the future (not in a year or two, but still. The more IoT and services catch on, the sooner it will start breaking).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That is because NAT allows private addresses like `192.168.0.52` to reach the Internet at large. It does that by changing source address `192.168.0.52` to public IP of your router, but replaces source port with free one from the pool. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, your first connection might be `192.168.0.52:1000` might be [(CG)-NATed][4] to (public IP) `198.51.100.1:1000`, and your neighbour `192.168.0.77:1000` might get NATed to `198.51.100.1:1001`. Your second connection from `192.168.0.52:1001` would then be NATed to `198.51.100.1:1002` etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Problem is, even simple stuff like opening a web page will likely open dozens of connections and use a dozen of ports (for DNS queries, HTTP(S) connection for different elements, JS analytics on different sites etc). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More expensive programs, like torrent clients, will easily use up a **thousands of ports**. And there is only **65535** ports available for any IP.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Which means several of your neighbours sharing the same CGNAT IP use a bigger share of connections (and more IoTs will mean more connections), and suddenly all of 65535 ports on that public IP 198.51.100.1 are used. Which means no new connections can be established for you and your neighbours. Which on bigger scale means lots people are cut from their IoTs, and civilisation as we know it collapses :-)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since we would like to delay this civilisation collapse as long as possible, we're transitioning to [IPv6][5] instead.

As more and more people come online, we're starting to reach the point where IPs have to be shared across multiple people, not just one household ([carrier-grade NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT)), which is unacceptable, and not just a problem for IoT.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;IPv6 allows us to move to a more *semantic* representation where **one IP = one device**, which has several advantages. If you're directly able to address your smart device (be it a toaster, oven, light bulb, TV, or something else), you can just send your commands **directly to the device**, rather than needing to go through a hub. At the moment, NAT makes this difficult to set up, because it requires specifically port forwarding your IoT devices (and this may not work at all for carrier-grade NAT).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It might be worth reading ['Switching to IPv6 implies dropping NAT. Is that a good thing?'](http://serverfault.com/questions/184524/switching-to-ipv6-implies-dropping-nat-is-that-a-good-thing) from Server Fault if you're worried about the security implication; having all your IoT devices given a public IPv6 address is not really a big security flaw; it's something that would still cause a problem on a NAT-enabled network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[This IEEE article](http://iot.ieee.org/newsletter/july-2015/the-case-for-ipv6-as-an-enabler-of-the-internet-of-things.html) has some good points:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The next logical step from networks of mobile devices to networks of communicating &quot;Things&quot; is IoT. That next step will mirror the sequence of events experienced by mobile networks. Proprietary protocols came first, because an individual company’s profits often come before consideration of the common good. But the use of IP and transparency (i.e., open source protocols) is fundamental to IoT development, just as the ease of use and the invisibility of the technology is important to end users. Our view, based on our research, is that the value of transparency and ease-of-use, and even more importantly the need for interoperability, will favor IPv6 adoption by the IoT market.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, in short:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- At the moment, 1 IPv4 address represents... *who knows?* Sometimes a device, sometimes a router, sometimes a whole network of different customers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Using an IPv6 lets you give each IoT device a 'name' on the Internet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Being able to address your devices lets you control them, and simplifies setup and management." />

To train the AI to recognise a person, you have to provide the name of the person to recognise and at least one image of them; after this, new images are sent to the API so that Microsoft's servers can process them and see if they match.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Are these images sent via the API stored securely and deleted at an appropriate time, or does Microsoft keep the images forever? Can I remove the data at all, or does Home Assistant's facial recognition mean that images from my home are permanently stored in the cloud?**&#xD;&#xA;" />

Sum up your requirements towards the microcontroller. For example in this case:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **1 hardware timer**, to measure time between trigger and echo pulses.&#xD;&#xA; - **2 GPIO pins** to interface the sensor Echo and Trigger pins.&#xD;&#xA; - Possibly **UART** to interface the RF communication module.&#xD;&#xA; - **1 ADC input** to monitor the battery voltage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;You can get along with a 8 pin controller for this, which might requires usage of the programmer pins for general purposes as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Decide the required **CPU performance** and **memory requirements**. Is it enough to use a 8-bit MCU or you need a 32-bit one instead? What CPU clock speeds are acceptable tens of MHz or 1 MHz is enough? How much program memory, RAM and ROM are needed?&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA; Given the described application, you do not need high computing performance. Probably a 8-bit controller will suffice (though won't be much cheaper than a 32-bit one so you can decide here by the price maybe).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. **Low power**. When it is not crucial you can probably get along with almost any kind of controller using its low power mode with the lowest supply voltage and system clock frequency.&#xD;&#xA; If it is more important you can start narrowing down your search list by starting with dedicated low-power MCU cores like (ARM® Cortex®-M0 or M0+ CPU cores). Usually the datasheets contain tables for most of the **low power modes/VCC/SysClk frequency**, better ones will list the consumption of each peripherals as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. **Developer tools**. I consider it as a very important aspect. Dedicated hardware programmer tools can cost fortunes so usually I stick to MCUs I have already had programmers for. When you switch to another family or brand it is good to invest into a development board that has an on-board programmer which could be used later to program your custom boards. In general always check first that how much will it cost to be able to download programs to a microcontroller.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As @Sean has pointed out in the comments, a possible and cost effective solution would be to search for such RF modules that comes with an integrated, programmable application MCU, which can run your firmware while handling the RF communication part as well. Such modules exists for BLE, WiFi and ZigBee and possibly for many other technologies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition about how will any MCU survive in the well. It will all comes down on the enclosure you will provide for the device. For example it won't matter much which MCU you choose if the enclosure is not 100% water resistant.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;TL;DR; Here comes the product specific part.&#xD;&#xA;--------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. You can choose the [ATtiny25][1] which costs [0.87$/1 piece][2] on Farnell. 8-bit, 8-pin so won't take much space. In Power-down mode it consumes 0.2 μA with disabled watchdog, at 3 V. 2-4 μA if the watchdog is enabled.&#xD;&#xA;It is [Arduino compatible][3] so programming it won't cost you much (USBasp or AVRdude programmer costs about 2$ on eBay). (**Note that**: you should use Arduino Software Serial library to interface an RF communication module, as this MCU only has SPI by hardware.) All in all small, small, cheap, small, relatively low power consumption, the **bit-banged UART might be complicate it**. It has 2 kB program memory which should be enough for you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Or go with an ARM Cortex M0, which consumes 2 μA in Standby mode and 5 μA in Stop mode, much less than the ATtiny. Such MCU is for example [STM32F030F4][4] which costs [1.09$/1 piece][5]. It is a more powerful 32-bit controller with a maximum of 48 MHz system clock frequency, but as you can see only for +0.2$. It comes with 16 kB program memory, far than enough for this simple task. It has SPI, UART, I2C and plenty other peripherals.&#xD;&#xA; Programming it will costs more, [dedicated programmer][6] costs 20$ at Farnell. **In my opinion, not worth it. Instead you can invest in a development board for the F0 family which has an on-board programmer (ST-LINK)**. [STM32F0Discovery][7] board costs [~10$][8]. You can start prototyping with this board and use it as a programmer later.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.atmel.com/images/atmel-2586-avr-8-bit-microcontroller-attiny25-attiny45-attiny85_datasheet.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.newark.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Search?catalogId=15003&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=10194&amp;sort=P_PRICE&amp;eq=N%3D422%2B2203%26amp%3BNtk%3Ddesc_pn%26amp%3BNtt%3DAttiny25%26amp%3BNtx%3Drel%2Bgensearch_store_specific%252cstatic%2528P_STORE_MARKETING_RANK_NEWARK_US%252cascending%2529%2Bmode%2Bmatchpartialmax%26amp%3BNty%3D1%26amp%3BNtpc%3D1%26amp%3BNtpr%3D1%26amp%3BD%3DAttiny25*%26amp%3BDn%3D2203%2B2203%26amp%3BDx%3Dmode%2Bmatchall&amp;st=Attiny25&amp;selectedCategoryId=%5BLjava.lang.String%3B%403fb43fb4&amp;showResults=true&amp;aa=true&amp;vw=&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://github.com/damellis/attiny/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/datasheet/a4/5d/0b/0e/87/c4/4d/71/DM00088500.pdf/files/DM00088500.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.DM00088500.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.newark.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Search?catalogId=15003&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=10194&amp;sort=P_PRICE&amp;eq=N%3D422%2B2203%26amp%3BNtk%3Ddesc_pn%26amp%3BNtt%3DSTM32F030F4%26amp%3BNtx%3Drel%2Bgensearch_store_specific%252cstatic%2528P_STORE_MARKETING_RANK_NEWARK_US%252cascending%2529%2Bmode%2Bmatchpartialmax%26amp%3BNty%3D1%26amp%3BNtpc%3D1%26amp%3BNtpr%3D1%26amp%3BD%3DSTM32F030F4*%26amp%3BDn%3D2203%2B2203%26amp%3BDx%3Dmode%2Bmatchall&amp;st=STM32F030F4&amp;selectedCategoryId=%5BLjava.lang.String%3B%406cc06cc0&amp;showResults=true&amp;aa=true&amp;vw=&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://www.newark.com/stmicroelectronics/st-link-v2/icd-programmer-for-stm8-stm32/dp/46T6935?ost=STM32&amp;categoryId=800000004034&amp;searchView=table&amp;iscrfnonsku=false&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f0discovery.html&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: https://www.arrow.com/en/products/stm32f0discovery/stmicroelectronics?gclid=CMH344ih4NECFRVuGwodRvEA9g" />

Sum up your requirements towards the microcontroller. For example in this case:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **1 hardware timer**, to measure time between trigger and echo pulses.&#xD;&#xA; - **2 GPIO pins** to interface the sensor Echo and Trigger pins.&#xD;&#xA; - Possibly **UART** to interface the RF communication module.&#xD;&#xA; - **1 ADC input** to monitor the battery voltage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &lt;br&gt;You can get along with a 8 pin controller for this, which might requires usage of the programmer pins for general purposes as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Decide the required **CPU performance** and **memory requirements**. Is it enough to use a 8-bit MCU or you need a 32-bit one instead? What CPU clock speeds are acceptable tens of MHz or 1 MHz is enough? How much program memory, RAM and ROM are needed?&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA; Given the described application, you do not need high computing performance. Probably a 8-bit controller will suffice (though won't be much cheaper than a 32-bit one so you can decide here by the price maybe).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. **Low power**. When it is not crucial you can probably get along with almost any kind of controller using its low power mode with the lowest supply voltage and system clock frequency.&#xD;&#xA; If it is more important you can start narrowing down your search list by starting with dedicated low-power MCU cores like (ARM® Cortex®-M0 or M0+ CPU cores). Usually the datasheets contain tables for most of the **low power modes/VCC/SysClk frequency**, better ones will list the consumption of each peripherals as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. **Developer tools**. I consider it as a very important aspect. Dedicated hardware programmer tools can cost fortunes so usually I stick to MCUs I have already had programmers for. When you switch to another family or brand it is good to invest into a development board that has an on-board programmer which could be used later to program your custom boards. In general always check first that how much will it cost to be able to download programs to a microcontroller.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As @Sean has pointed out in the comments, a possible and cost effective solution would be to search for such RF modules that comes with an integrated, programmable application MCU, which can run your firmware while handling the RF communication part as well. Such modules exists for BLE, WiFi and ZigBee and possibly for many other technologies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition about how will any MCU survive in the well. It will all comes down on the enclosure you will provide for the device. For example it won't matter much which MCU you choose if the enclosure is not 100% water resistant.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;TL;DR; Here comes the product specific part.&#xD;&#xA;--------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. You can choose the [ATtiny25][1] which costs [0.87$/1 piece][2] on Farnell. 8-bit, 8-pin so won't take much space. In Power-down mode it consumes 0.2 μA with disabled watchdog, at 3 V. 2-4 μA if the watchdog is enabled.&#xD;&#xA;It is [Arduino compatible][3] so programming it won't cost you much (USBasp or AVRdude programmer costs about 2$ on eBay). (**Note that**: you should use Arduino Software Serial library to interface an RF communication module, as this MCU only has SPI by hardware.) All in all small, small, cheap, small, relatively low power consumption, the **bit-banged UART might complicates it** though. It has 2 kB program memory which should be enough for you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Or go with an ARM Cortex M0, which consumes 2 μA in Standby mode and 5 μA in Stop mode. Such MCU is for example [STM32F030F4][4] which costs [1.09$/1 piece][5]. It is a more powerful 32-bit controller with a maximum of 48 MHz system clock frequency, but as you can see only for +0.2$. It comes with 16 kB program memory, far than enough for this simple task. It has SPI, UART, I2C and plenty other peripherals.&#xD;&#xA; Programming it will costs more, [dedicated programmer][6] costs 20$ at Farnell. **In my opinion, not worth it. Instead you can invest in a development board for the F0 family which has an on-board programmer (ST-LINK)**. [STM32F0Discovery][7] board costs [~10$][8]. You can start prototyping with this board and use it as a programmer later.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.atmel.com/images/atmel-2586-avr-8-bit-microcontroller-attiny25-attiny45-attiny85_datasheet.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.newark.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Search?catalogId=15003&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=10194&amp;sort=P_PRICE&amp;eq=N%3D422%2B2203%26amp%3BNtk%3Ddesc_pn%26amp%3BNtt%3DAttiny25%26amp%3BNtx%3Drel%2Bgensearch_store_specific%252cstatic%2528P_STORE_MARKETING_RANK_NEWARK_US%252cascending%2529%2Bmode%2Bmatchpartialmax%26amp%3BNty%3D1%26amp%3BNtpc%3D1%26amp%3BNtpr%3D1%26amp%3BD%3DAttiny25*%26amp%3BDn%3D2203%2B2203%26amp%3BDx%3Dmode%2Bmatchall&amp;st=Attiny25&amp;selectedCategoryId=%5BLjava.lang.String%3B%403fb43fb4&amp;showResults=true&amp;aa=true&amp;vw=&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://github.com/damellis/attiny/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/datasheet/a4/5d/0b/0e/87/c4/4d/71/DM00088500.pdf/files/DM00088500.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.DM00088500.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.newark.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Search?catalogId=15003&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=10194&amp;sort=P_PRICE&amp;eq=N%3D422%2B2203%26amp%3BNtk%3Ddesc_pn%26amp%3BNtt%3DSTM32F030F4%26amp%3BNtx%3Drel%2Bgensearch_store_specific%252cstatic%2528P_STORE_MARKETING_RANK_NEWARK_US%252cascending%2529%2Bmode%2Bmatchpartialmax%26amp%3BNty%3D1%26amp%3BNtpc%3D1%26amp%3BNtpr%3D1%26amp%3BD%3DSTM32F030F4*%26amp%3BDn%3D2203%2B2203%26amp%3BDx%3Dmode%2Bmatchall&amp;st=STM32F030F4&amp;selectedCategoryId=%5BLjava.lang.String%3B%406cc06cc0&amp;showResults=true&amp;aa=true&amp;vw=&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://www.newark.com/stmicroelectronics/st-link-v2/icd-programmer-for-stm8-stm32/dp/46T6935?ost=STM32&amp;categoryId=800000004034&amp;searchView=table&amp;iscrfnonsku=false&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f0discovery.html&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: https://www.arrow.com/en/products/stm32f0discovery/stmicroelectronics?gclid=CMH344ih4NECFRVuGwodRvEA9g" />

To initiate many-to-one&#xD;&#xA;route discovery, the concentrator broadcast a many-to-one route request to the entire network. Upon receipt of the&#xD;&#xA;route request, every device adds a route table entry for the concentrator and stores the one hop neighbor that relays&#xD;&#xA;the request as the next hop address. No route reply will be generated.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Many-to-one route request command is similar to unicast route request command with same command ID and&#xD;&#xA;payload frame format. The option field in route request is many-to-one and the destination address is 0xFFFC. The&#xD;&#xA;following Z-Stack API can be used for the concentrator to send out many-to-one route request. Please refer to the ZStack&#xD;&#xA;API documentation for detailed usage about this API.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; `ZStatus_t NLME_RouteDiscoveryRequest( uint16 DstAddress, byte options, uint8 radius )`&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[*Fault Tolerance in ZigBee Wireless Sensor Networks*](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/publications/2724/download/) is an interesting paper with some more information about how ZigBee networks tolerate node failure. It appears that the implementation used there reconstructed the network when one of the nodes was removed (the exact method of this is not clear, unfortunately), so that the malfunctioning node is no longer included in the mesh. In some cases, this led to sensors becoming 'orphaned' before requesting to rejoin the mesh network via a different route.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In summary, from the resources I've found: **it depends on your implementation, but most will re-evaluate the routing table reasonably frequently to avoid broken nodes from harming the network**. I suspect you'll be able to get a more accurate response if you ask the vendor of your specific ZigBee implementation, since the exact operation will vary." />

Given your range requirements of 30 metres, you will likely need to use a [Class 1 Bluetooth Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth#Uses):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Class 1, primarily for industrial use cases, [have a range of up to] 100 metres (300 ft). Bluetooth Marketing qualifies that Class 1 range is in most cases 20–30 metres (66–98 ft)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would imagine the lower range would occur in situations where there was not a clear path for the radio transmissions, and perhaps in challenging radio environments. Outside, I would imagine this is less of a problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, assuming the above is true: you will be transmitting for **1/30th** of an hour,  at approximately **100mW** during the transmission phase.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hence, per hour, you will consume approximately [0.00333 Wh][1] of energy. For comparison, a 'long-life' alkaline AA battery stores around [2.6 Wh of energy](http://www.allaboutbatteries.com/Energy-tables.html). Therefore, your battery would last about **30 days with Bluetooth 3.0**, which isn't *really* bad, but could be a lot better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These calculations are all very rough, but they should be in the ballpark if the assumptions are correct. [EE Times](http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1273485) suggests that 5% of the time transmitting is on the high end, and my estimate of 2 seconds / minute is roughly 3.33%.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) might be more viable; [this page](https://www.link-labs.com/bluetooth-zigbee-comparison/) suggests 10mW power for a 77m range, which would give a battery life closer to [1 year][2] (325 days, more precisely!). However, this would require new hardware, which is, admittedly, a disadvantage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I mentioned in a comment, this sort of setup seems perfect for a mesh network, and that *should* reduce your range requirements significantly, since you won't have to transmit 30 metres to the hub, just 2 or 3 metres to the next beehive. In that case, you could probably get away with a much less powerful radio, which would save battery life.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It may be worth considering one of the mesh protocols such as [ZigBee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZigBee) or the new [BLE Mesh](https://blog.bluetooth.com/bluetooth-and-mesh-smart-combination) protocol, which would both suit your use-case well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1]: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(2%2F60)+hours+*+0.1W&#xD;&#xA;[2]: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(2.6+%2F+((2%2F60)+*+0.01))+%2F+24" />

It primarily targets online consumer devices such as remote cameras and home routers. The Mirai botnet has been used in some of the largest and most disruptive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, including an attack on 20 September 2016  on computer security journalist Brian Krebs's web site, an attack on French web host OVH and the October 2016 Dyn cyberattack.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The article (and others I have read online) shows that Mirai makes the attack by grubbing the internet for devices that are using factory default usernames and passwords from a database.

To do so let's see some smart plug reference designs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. One from [Atmel][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; [![enter image description here][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. One from [Texas Instruments][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; [![enter image description here][4]][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you can see the parts of these two different designs are quite the same.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - There is an AC/DC power supply which provides the DC voltage for the sub-circuits.&#xD;&#xA; - There is a &quot;brain&quot;, a Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller unit. The ATSAMW25 and the CC3200.&#xD;&#xA; - There are some dedicated hardware for power measurement.&#xD;&#xA; - A relay to be able to switch the mains lines.&#xD;&#xA; - Some feedback LED and buttons to interface the plug locally.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Basically the power consumption of the plug itself is the total power consumption of these parts. The main consumers are the Wi-Fi enabled microcontrollers, the relays and I believe that the LEDs consume more than the metering parts. On the top of these comes the efficiency of the AC/DC power supply, there will be a certain amount of power loss on these elements.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. **Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Most of the time the application processor will be in low-power mode with a current consumption between μA and mA. The Wi-Fi will add some more consumption, a couple of mA in its idle state.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; The [CC3200][5] for example consumes 12 mA if the application MCU is in Sleep mode (not deep sleep) and the Network Processor is in idle connected state. In case of RX the consumption rises to 56 mA and in case of TX to 270 mA maximum. (Detailed tables on page 32.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Of course these parameters can vary for different devices from different manufacturers but roughly the scale is the same.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. **Relays**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; There can be significant losses depending on the relay type. There is loss because of the coil, called coil power. This can be even hundreds of mW ([10A, 240 VAC relay 500 - 700 mW coil power, cheapest on Farnell][6]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; And there is loss because of the contact resistance (100 mΩ for the previous relay, and with a 10 A load it dissipates some power). More expensive ones have better parameters, [there are ones with 50 mΩ resistance][7] for example.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; I am sure that the low cost knockoff plugs have cheaper relays so possibly consumes somewhat more.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. **LEDs**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; Worth noting the couple of mA, but nothing more.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. **AC/DC power supply**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; This will add a percentage on the top of the overall consumption. Cheaper converters probably have lower efficiency, so an cheap plug would consume more in this case too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; The [UCC28910 700V Flyback Switcher][8] from TI's design has a typical of 75% efficiency according to the datasheet (page 30.). There can be worse ones not much better. Again it gives a rough scale.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All of these can vary of course but mainly these are the factors that determine the consumption of the device itself.&#xD;&#xA;You could calculate a worst-case consumption for TI's design to get a W value. And of course you can check parameters of certain products.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.atmel.com/tools/smart-plug-reference-design.aspx&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/pxok6.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/tidu983/tidu983.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/dCzqB.png&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/cc3200.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/2043478.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/1514130.pdf?_ga=1.8666613.1331750453.1470678477&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ucc28910.pdf" />

This sensor has a backlit LCD that displays a timer, illumination, transmission status and battery status. It has a lux (measurement relating to amount of visible light present) detecting range from 0 (darkness) to 3000 and a countdown timer that is adjustable from one minute up to eight hours. The sensor has a 60dB (decibel) built-in beeping tone/alert and has a wall-mountable design for use indoors or outdoors. The Z-Wave Wireless Illumination Sensor can be enrolled into any Z-Wave network to begin communicating with other Z-Wave enabled devices. It has an operating range up to 100 feet and is powered by three 1.5V AA batteries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, this device seems suitable because:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- it is rated for both indoor and outdoor use&#xD;&#xA;- it can detect from 0 - 3000 lux, so [although it won't detect bright sunlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight), it should be able to tell between overcast and sunny conditions&#xD;&#xA;- configurable lux settings so that you can reduce false positive detections.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Vera Hub [seems to have relatively good support for the sensor](http://wiki.micasaverde.com/index.php/Everspring_Sensors), so it's an option if you can't find any Wi-Fi sensors that meet your requirements.

This can be even hundreds of mW ([10A, 240 VAC relay 500 - 700 mW coil power, cheapest on Farnell][6]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; And there is loss because of the contact resistance (100 mΩ for the previous relay, and with a 10 A load it dissipates some power).

Do I have to design the interface in Photoshop first and then create an HTML page to import my data from Google Sheet or AM I getting it wrong?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It depends on your approach. If you're able to design it in HTML, go ahead and do that, then use a framework like jQuery, Angular or ReactJS to connect your UI to the APIs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I might have misunderstood but it does not seem like Google Sheets nor Excel enable auto synch for the devices. It sounds like I have to enter the data manually...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's true, you would have to manually rerun the request in Google Sheets. If you used a HTML page like I mentioned in response to the last question, that wouldn't be a problem as data would have to be fetched new each time from the API.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You could either go the HTML route **or** the Google Sheets route; if you're able, the HTML method would work a lot better and give you more flexibility." />

This sort of application will probably be marginal for upstream bandwidth on a lot of domestic internet connections today - that gives more incentive to perform either processing or at least compression on the edge. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The audio decoding of a smart home hub is another example. Certainly, the wake-word detection makes sense to perform at the hub (if only for privacy). Once the edge node has the processing capability required for voice control, maybe it makes sense to push that processing to the edge. For the service provider, this is a free gain - the node already needs a low-end linux capable platform, so why not make use of this resource rather than providing bandwidth and CPU in the cloud. Significantly, the bandwidth is likely to cost as much as the CPU in this context.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even if the bandwidth load is reduced, an application may still be able to use edge computing and save cloud resource by making use of compute power which already exists in the edge node. Remember, the edge needs to encrypt any data it upstreams - this may cost as much as processing it locally.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What has changed in the equation is the cost of provisioning an additional number of DMIPS at the edge (either in home, in the cell-site or in the backhaul).

The choice to sample data at a particular frequency, whether that is 1Hz or 100Khz (particularly with analogue data), is a form of edge processing. Very few scenarios will transmit data at the maximum clock cycle of the processor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some scenarios where explicit edge processing is useful&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Bandwidth constraints**. The often-quoted example is in the oil and gas industry where a lot of telemetry is gathered, and the bandwidth from the remote location is limited.&#xD;&#xA; - **Low latency requirement**. Especially in control systems where something needs to happen in response to data. When sub-second responses mean the difference between normal operation and failure, a second or two round-trip to the cloud is unacceptable.&#xD;&#xA; - **Extremely low value of data**. If nothing is likely to be gained from recording data, even in the future with sophisticated analytics, you might as well summarise and drop it at the edge. For example, mains power in the EU is expressed as 'nominally 230 V ±10% at 50Hz'. Given that you can handle that range, there is no point in transmitting the precise voltage every 100ms. If is better to transmit 'from this time to this time, the voltage was nominal'.&#xD;&#xA; - **As a failure mode**. Connectivity to the cloud, or at least some of the processing, is likely to fail. All systems should be able to perform some edge-processing, even if it is dumbed-down, as a failure mode.&#xD;&#xA; - **Non-IP mesh** The cloud will only be accessible via a gateway for non-IP devices, such as those that communicate over a low-power network or CAN bus-type wired connection. It may be preferable for devices communicate directly with each other in a 'mesh', in which case IP connectivity isn't needed, never mind cloud connectivity. Mesh is the holy grail of edge computing, but difficult to do.&#xD;&#xA; - **Privacy, trust, and regulatory issues** Data can be collected that may be useful and valuable for analytics, but getting customer consent to collection and storage of the data may be difficult, and the cost and risk associated with managing access to the data may be too high. Facial recognition, and most image processing, is the obvious example. Another example is that all modern vehicles have GPS and connectivity built-in for emergency call response. Vehicle manufacturers and dealers could derive valuable insights from a stream of GPS data, but location data is personally identifiable in this scenario and shouldn't be collected, transmitted, processed and stored.&#xD;&#xA; - **Security** We are aware that IoT is currently suffering from security issues. While it is possible to create a secure environment with cloud-connected devices, security is a major issue that needs to be actively worked on. Highly secure gateways, edge-based threat detection and other as-yet unknown defense mechanisms are going to be necessary in most environments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When considering material about edge processing, remember to consider the source. Existing IT vendors that haven't cracked the cloud market (IBM, HP, Cisco) are worried that IoT, as the next big thing, bypasses them altogether. As a result they will aggressively market edge processing. Indeed, 'fog computing' is a term created by Cisco to have a 'cloud' closer to the ground (or something). Obviously cloud vendors are marketing the reverse, for their own bottom line.&#xD;&#xA; " />

Here is the config file's logging part:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    # Note that if the broker is running as a Windows service it will default to&#xD;&#xA;    # &quot;log_dest none&quot; and neither stdout nor stderr logging is available.&#xD;&#xA;    # Use &quot;log_dest none&quot; if you wish to disable logging.&#xD;&#xA;    log_dest stdout&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    # If using syslog logging (not on Windows), messages will be logged to the&#xD;&#xA;    # &quot;daemon&quot; facility by default. Use the log_facility option to choose which of&#xD;&#xA;    # local0 to local7 to log to instead. The option value should be an integer&#xD;&#xA;    # value, e.g. &quot;log_facility 5&quot; to use local5.&#xD;&#xA;    #log_facility&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    # Types of messages to log. Use multiple log_type lines for logging&#xD;&#xA;    # multiple types of messages.&#xD;&#xA;    # Possible types are: debug, error, warning, notice, information, &#xD;&#xA;    # none, subscribe, unsubscribe, websockets, all.&#xD;&#xA;    # Note that debug type messages are for decoding the incoming/outgoing&#xD;&#xA;    # network packets. They are not logged in &quot;topics&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;    log_type error&#xD;&#xA;    log_type warning&#xD;&#xA;    log_type notice&#xD;&#xA;    log_type information&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    # Change the websockets logging level. This is a global option, it is not&#xD;&#xA;    # possible to set per listener. This is an integer that is interpreted by&#xD;&#xA;    # libwebsockets as a bit mask for its lws_log_levels enum.

But I see no logging on the console.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of `stdout` I have tried to log into a file, and changed the configuration as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    log_dest file d:\mosquitto.txt&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have created the file manually and started the broker in the same way but no avail.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;I do not get any log message if I do not use the `-v` option.&#xD;&#xA;How should it be done properly?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://iot.stackexchange.com/q/955/14&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://stackoverflow.com/q/13986313/3820025" />

The choice to sample data at a particular frequency, whether that is 1Hz or 100Khz (particularly with analogue data), is a form of edge processing. Very few scenarios will transmit data at the maximum clock cycle of the processor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some scenarios where explicit edge processing is useful&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - **Bandwidth constraints**. The often-quoted example is in the oil and gas industry where a lot of telemetry is gathered, and the bandwidth from the remote location is limited.&#xD;&#xA; - **Low latency requirement**. Especially in control systems where something needs to happen in response to data. When sub-second responses mean the difference between normal operation and failure, a second or two round-trip to the cloud is unacceptable.&#xD;&#xA; - **Extremely low value of data**. If nothing is likely to be gained from recording data, even in the future with sophisticated analytics, you might as well summarise and drop it at the edge. For example, mains power in the EU is expressed as 'nominally 230 V ±10% at 50Hz'. Given that you can handle that range, there is no point in transmitting the precise voltage every 100ms. If is better to transmit 'from this time to this time, the voltage was nominal'.&#xD;&#xA; - **Ordering of events is important**. Devices have a narrower scope and can perform some derivations easier than the cloud. One of these is where the derivation requires that the data is in order. For example, it is easy on a device when measuring, say voltage, when it enters the on or off state. Timestamping the voltage measurement and sending it to the cloud makes the derivation harder as data may come out of order, delayed or be completely lost.&#xD;&#xA; - **As a failure mode**. Connectivity to the cloud, or at least some of the processing, is likely to fail. All systems should be able to perform some edge-processing, even if it is dumbed-down, as a failure mode.&#xD;&#xA; - **Non-IP mesh** The cloud will only be accessible via a gateway for non-IP devices, such as those that communicate over a low-power network or CAN bus-type wired connection. It may be preferable for devices communicate directly with each other in a 'mesh', in which case IP connectivity isn't needed, never mind cloud connectivity. Mesh is the holy grail of edge computing, but difficult to do.&#xD;&#xA; - **Privacy, trust, and regulatory issues** Data can be collected that may be useful and valuable for analytics, but getting customer consent to collection and storage of the data may be difficult, and the cost and risk associated with managing access to the data may be too high. Facial recognition, and most image processing, is the obvious example. Another example is that all modern vehicles have GPS and connectivity built-in for emergency call response. Vehicle manufacturers and dealers could derive valuable insights from a stream of GPS data, but location data is personally identifiable in this scenario and shouldn't be collected, transmitted, processed and stored.&#xD;&#xA; - **Security** We are aware that IoT is currently suffering from security issues. While it is possible to create a secure environment with cloud-connected devices, security is a major issue that needs to be actively worked on. Highly secure gateways, edge-based threat detection and other as-yet unknown defense mechanisms are going to be necessary in most environments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When considering material about edge processing, remember to consider the source. Existing IT vendors that haven't cracked the cloud market (IBM, HP, Cisco) are worried that IoT, as the next big thing, bypasses them altogether. As a result they will aggressively market edge processing. Indeed, 'fog computing' is a term created by Cisco to have a 'cloud' closer to the ground (or something). Obviously cloud vendors are marketing the reverse, for their own bottom line.&#xD;&#xA; " />

Quite a lot of devices, especially sensors and actuators (like door locks and motors), use other protocols such as [ZigBee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZigBee), [Z-Wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-Wave), [Bluetooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth) and [Thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(network_protocol)), so they can't 'speak' directly with your Wi-Fi router. The hub acts as a **translator**, being able to communicate with both Wi-Fi networks and other protocols (almost always ZigBee and Z-Wave, but sometimes others too).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## What's the difference between Wi-Fi and these other protocols?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Wi-Fi works well for applications where you're transmitting a *lot* of data, throughout your house. For example, if you're streaming a video across your house, you'll have no problems at all using Wi-Fi. But, [as explained by Time](http://time.com/3745059/smart-home-wireless-networks/), Wi-Fi isn't perfect for every use case:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Wi-Fi is a whole-home network,” says Chris Coley, principle engineer and architect with Logitech. Primarily used for media streaming, browsing the web, and other data-heavy activities, it’s a high-bandwidth network that’s power-intensive — just watch how fast your laptop battery dies when you’re watching a video on Netflix. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Many smart home products eschew Wi-Fi-connectivity because it would require their devices to have a dedicated power source or a long-lasting battery.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It'd be very costly if every networked device in your home used Wi-Fi, and your shiny new LED bulbs might use even more power than old, incandescent light bulbs, so devices like this turn to other protocols, such as ZigBee or Z-Wave. Philips Hue bulbs, for example, [use ZigBee](https://www.developers.meethue.com/documentation/how-hue-works), which is why the bridge is needed to 'translate' back to Wi-Fi so all the other devices can interface with it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can see how ZigBee and Bluetooth compare on page 51 of [*A Comparative Study of Wireless Protocols: Bluetooth, UWB, ZigBee, and Wi-Fi*](http://eee.guc.edu.eg/Announcements/Comparaitive_Wireless_Standards.pdf); in Figure 6, you can see that Wi-Fi consumes **far** less power per megabit. *So, why don't we use Wi-Fi for everything?* If you look at Figure 5, you can see that each Wi-Fi transmission uses far more power than ZigBee (Wi-Fi uses about 700mW, compared to ZigBee's power usage of less than 100mW).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For your light bulb, or thermostat, Wi-Fi doesn't make a lot of sense. If your device is just sending a few bytes worth of data (e.g. just a number), why waste loads of power on each transmission?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**In short: Wi-Fi makes sense when you're sending large amounts of data across long distances. Your devices probably don't need to do that, so other protocols make far more sense**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## What else do the hubs do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some hubs, like [SmartThings](https://www.smartthings.com/uk/), can run pre-programmed routines ('automations') and allow you to customise their behaviour. Often, devices provide [IDEs](http://docs.smartthings.com/en/latest/tools-and-ide/editor-and-simulator.html) or editors so that you can customise the rules. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You might be able to integrate with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/discover) with some hubs (particularly [Wink](https://ifttt.com/wink_shortcuts) and [SmartThings](https://ifttt.com/smartthings)), which might be the simplest way of linking services together if you're not able to program using your hubs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Do I really need a hub?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This really depends on your personal setup. If all of your devices use Wi-Fi, then no, it's probably not necessary. One [FAQ on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/wiki/index#wiki_faq) has a concise explanation:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A close parallel can be drawn between a hub and a standard Wi-Fi router. In simple terms, both are boxes with radios and a little bit of smartness. Eventually, hubs and Wi-Fi routers may merge into one product (indeed, the Almond line of routers from Securify already do this), but currently most households will need to buy a hub because no other device in the house has the requisite radios to talk to the various switches and sensors. In addition, the hub must remain in the house so that automation can continue even when no person is there. This allows for presence simulation in “vacation mode” or pre-heating or pre-cooling the house before arrival.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In effect: **lots of hubs don't just 'translate', they can also perform some processing and automate things that the manufacturer didn't provide by default.** If you want the flexibility of customising how your devices work and interact, a hub is a great idea. If you're just planning to have a voice assistant (like a Google Home or Amazon Echo) and want to fetch the weather, there's probably no need just yet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To figure out *which* hub you should pick, consider the following points:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Which protocols do your devices use?**  &#xD;&#xA;  You should be able to search for hubs which are compatible with a specific protocol. For example, when I searched for &quot;Z-Wave hubs&quot;, I found [this list of products](http://buildyoursmarthome.co/reviews/best-z-wave-controller/), so you can get some additional guidance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Do your devices list specific integrations with a hub?**  &#xD;&#xA;  For example, the ecobee3 specifically lists SmartThings and Wink as compatible; you should factor this into your decision.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Does the hub you're looking at allow you to automate things simply?**  &#xD;&#xA;  Some hubs may use a programming language you're unfamiliar with. It's probably best to avoid them, otherwise you're stuck with a device you can't control! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, if that was all too much to read:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Bridges generally just 'translate' from one protocol to another, and tend to only work with one device or manufacturer (e.g. the Hue bridge).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Hubs can both translate and run automation routines themselves, allowing your devices to interact in a more complex way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- For anything more complex than a trivial setup, you probably need a hub. Make sure you research to find out which one suits you!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Vendors of chipsets will promote their chosen radio network, vendors of products will promote their management tools, and others will position themselves as the one hub to rule them all. People, and minnow tech companies, fed up with this try and promote standards, which often get co-opted by major players. You will see this where every 'standard' has an 'alliance' page, which is the source of their ability to produce a standard. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is no single 'hub', as there is no single vendor. People need to commit to an ecosystem (or two) and hope for the best. In much the same way that people will commit to the Apple or Android mobile ecosystem, they will commit to a 'smart home' ecosystem. Samsung wants to be the 'Apple of IoT', so does Philips, so do many others.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While there are efforts to standardise, because of the frustrations that you are questioning, it is unlikely that any standard will emerge soon, and even more unlikely that it will be a truly open standard.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This answer may seem cynical, and more opinion than fact, but IoT is a new market with huge rewards for vendors that dominate.

So similar to the first one, only because something is allowed doesn’t mean it should be used. UTF-8 knows many different white space types, it’s pretty obvious that such uncommon characters should be avoided.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's highly unlikely you're going to be using spaces any other way than just pressing the &lt;kbd&gt;SPACE&lt;/kbd&gt; key on your keyboard, so I don't think accidental usage of [homoglyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoglyph) is really going to be a problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Using non-ASCII UTF-8 character makes it really hard to find typos or issues related to the character set, because often they can not be displayed correctly. Unless it is really necessary we recommend avoid using non ASCII character in a topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fair point - typing non-ASCII characters can be a big problem. Personally, I would avoid `Garage_Sensor_001/Temperature/°C` simply because a lot of keyboards don't have a degrees symbol built-in (British keyboards certainly don't!). This decision is really based on practicality rather than due to the protocol; if you are able to use special characters without much fuss, and you're certain that no-one else will need to type the characters in, go for it!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, I'd be a little sceptical about some of HiveMQ's advice; further on in the page you linked, it says &quot;Don't subscribe to #&quot;, which [has already been disputed on the site](http://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/334/don-t-subscribe-to-so-how-to-dump-all-messages-to-database-with-mosquitto)!" />

I have coded many projects where a standalone PC reads &amp; displays some measurement.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you also want to controller the attached hardware, this is [SCADA][2]. Again, it need not necessarily be connected to the internet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can ask for hardware commendations for sensors &amp; controller at http://hardwarerecs.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And, once you have some code, you can get advice for problems at http://stackoverflow.com/ &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Generally, IoT for industry involves the client/server model, with the client measuring/controlling hardware devices and reporting to/receiving commands from the server. The server also generally has a database, and allows for generation of reports for management and alarms (and may instruct the remote hardware to reconfigure/shutdown based on data received).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Phew! That’s the intro out of the way. Now to get our hand dirty.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want to get into the nitty gritty of coding, look at [sockets][3], and understand the difference between [TCP][4] and [UDP][5].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fortunately, the decades have wrapped most of the trickier stuff in libraries, and you are probably best advised to read up on RESTful services.  There are numerous free online tutorials, courses and videos, depending on your language; C is a traditional embedded language, with some using C++, but of course, use whatever you know/feel comfortable with. Python is hugely popular and simple to learn, as well as being the recommended language for the Raspberry Pi. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Personally, I prefer compiled languages to interpreted, as it is easier to get the bugs out, but the choice is entirely up to you. Just make sure that it has good support for accessing peripherals over USB, Ethernet and - still extremely common in industry – serial port.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the server side, 90%+ of the world’s server are still running on PHP. However, there is an uptake on use of NodeJS, mainly from people who code browser apps, which currently can only be done in JavaScript and don’t want to learn two languages. I don’t recommend developing browser based IoT apps, because of the restrictions on browser code accessing the file system and peripherals (although, I would mention the likes of [Cordova][6], if you want to develop for smartphone).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To get started, I would recommend a [Raspberry Pi][7] (conging in Python or C).  And I *** highly*** recommend a sensor hat. This one is just an example, but it is not expensive and  contains    &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; -	Gyroscope – angular rate sensor: +/-245/500/2000dps Accelerometer   &#xD;&#xA; - Linear acceleration sensor: +/-2/4/8/16 g   &#xD;&#xA; - Magnetometer - Magnetic Sensor: +/- 4/8/12/16   &#xD;&#xA; - Gauss Barometer: 260 – 1260 hPa absolute range (accuracy depends on the temperature and pressure, +/- 0.1 hPa under normal conditions)   &#xD;&#xA; - Temperature sensor (Temperature accurate to +/- 2 degC in the 0-65 degC range)   &#xD;&#xA; - Relative Humidity sensor (accurate to +/- 4.5% in the 20-80%rH range, accurate to +/- 0.5 degC in 15-40 degC range)    &#xD;&#xA; - 8x8 RGB LED matrix display   &#xD;&#xA; - Small 5 button joystick&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That will allow you gather some data and report it to your server. You might be able to find a free service online to receive and display your data. I have seen some on other S.O site, but forget where.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But, you probably want to code your won server. I would recommend PHP as programming language. For Linux, you are well provided with [LAMP][8] (Linux, Apache, Mysql &amp; PHP). For Windows, you have to install a [WAMP][9] (Windows … etc). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can take your pick.

What you probably don't have is an understanding of basic electronics and the art of getting code from your desktop running on a small device.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Jumping in at the wrong level of complexity can be daunting, and may mean that you give up too soon. For example, people recommend the ESP8266 and NodeMCU without thinking that you need to get the right one, you need the chip mounted on a development board, you have to get your software on it, you need to wire it up to something, and only then are you able to run JavaScript. That is a lot of different skills that you need, and you could give up on any one of those stages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My recommendation is to start with an Arduino. Where Arduino made a difference in the maker community was how easy it is to plug an Arduino in a USB port, and the compile, build, deploy chain is all sorted for you. You can write some code, and flash some LEDs very quickly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also suggest that you start with the official [Arduino starter kit][1]. While it is very simple, the instructions are easy and you get a bunch of useful electronic bits and pieces (breadboard, jumper wires, LEDs, etc) that remain useful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't be put off by how basic the Arduino is. Get some enthusiasm going first for the electronics and hands-on part before trying anything too complex. If you find the electronics interesting and want to do more, stick with the Arduino and get a more complex kit. I bought the [BOE Shield-Bot robot][2]. It may not be the best or cheapest robot, but has a really good tutorial that goes into detail on how to controls servos and such. You also land up with a whole lot more useful bits.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you get through that, you'll either give up and get back to server-side software, or you will buy more bits, soldering irons, more boards and components. Very soon you'll land up with a drawer of broken dreams like the rest of us.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I wouldn't recommend using the Pi too soon. It's more of a computer than a thing, and doesn't have important features that are necessary in the beginning of your journey of understanding (like analogue input). You'll very quickly outgrow the Arduino (it doesn't connect to the Internet very easily), but it's a good place to see whether this will be something that you enjoy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoStarterKit&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://learn.parallax.com/tutorials/robot/shield-bot/robotics-board-education-shield-arduino" />

As has been remarked in the comments, this sounds mostly like a news report rant that hasn't really researched completely.  All the articles out there say essentially the same thing: no new research has been done to confirm suspicions, and all articles find their source (eventually) in a [single article by abiresearch.com](https://www.abiresearch.com/press/nest-cam-works-around-clock/).  That article in and of itself is lacking; as @jterrace suggested, it would be very simple to just test data transmission.  However, none of these tests have been done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In other words, just from a surface glance, it looks not like an absolute scam, but like an insufficiently tested hypothesis which can't truly be proven from the information given.  Furthermore, I ran into a few articles like [this one from SlashGear.com](https://www.slashgear.com/no-nest-cam-isnt-secretly-spying-on-you-25416086/), which examines ABI's claims.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These articles point out that ABI has yet to explain why they feel that the current *ought* to drop when the camera is off.  We tend to think of it something like a DVD machine or TV screen that turns on in response to Infra Red, but in reality, the Nest Cam functions nothing like the same.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A TV only needs to have a small portion of its system booted up.  However, the Cam *must* have the **whole system** booted up, so as to be able to receive information over the network (drawing electricity) and start the camera as quickly as possible (which is estimated to take [45-60 seconds](https://www.slashgear.com/no-nest-cam-isnt-secretly-spying-on-you-25416086/) from cold boot).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The current staying at 340mA is not unusual: the camera must keep itself booted up and listening to the router.  And according to their spokesman:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;When Nest Cam is turned off from the user interface (UI), it does not fully power down, as we expect the camera to be turned on again at any point in time.  With that said, when Nest Cam is turned off, it completely stops transmitting video to the cloud, meaning it no longer observes its surroundings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So the answer is, **no, as far as we can tell, the Nest Cam is *not* recording you when it's off.**" />

I have coded many projects where a standalone PC reads &amp; displays some measurement.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you also want to controller the attached hardware, this is [SCADA][2]. Again, it need not necessarily be connected to the internet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's a diagram of SCADA, whcih gives avery good feel for the IoT in general. Note that the [PLC][3]s on the diagram are sensors and controls of IoT enabled devices.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][4]][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can ask for hardware commendations for sensors &amp; controller at [Hardware Recommendations](http://hardwarerecs.stackexchange.com/).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And, once you have some code, you can get advice for problems at [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Generally, IoT for industry involves the client/server model, with the client measuring/controlling hardware devices and reporting to/receiving commands from the server. The server also generally has a database, and allows for generation of reports for management and alarms (and may instruct the remote hardware to reconfigure/shutdown based on data received).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Phew! That’s the intro out of the way. Now to get our hands dirty.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want to get into the nitty gritty of coding, look at [sockets][5], and understand the difference between [TCP][6] and [UDP][7].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fortunately, the decades have wrapped most of the trickier stuff in libraries, and you are probably best advised to read up on RESTful services.  There are numerous free online tutorials, courses and videos, depending on your language; C is a traditional embedded language, with some using C++, but of course, use whatever you know/feel comfortable with. Python is hugely popular and simple to learn, as well as being the recommended language for the Raspberry Pi. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Personally, I prefer compiled languages to interpreted, as it is easier to get the bugs out, but the choice is entirely up to you. Just make sure that it has good support for accessing peripherals over USB, Ethernet and - still extremely common in industry – serial port.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the server side, 90%+ of the world’s server are still running on PHP. However, there is an uptake on use of NodeJS, mainly from people who code browser apps, which currently can only be done in JavaScript and don’t want to learn two languages. I don’t recommend developing browser based IoT apps, because of the restrictions on browser code accessing the file system and peripherals (although, I would mention the likes of [Cordova][8], if you want to develop for smartphone).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To get started, I would recommend a [Raspberry Pi][9] (conging in Python or C).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][10]][10]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  And I *** highly*** recommend a sensor hat. [This one][11] is just an example, but it is not expensive and  contains    &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; -	Gyroscope – angular rate sensor: +/-245/500/2000dps Accelerometer   &#xD;&#xA; - Linear acceleration sensor: +/-2/4/8/16 g   &#xD;&#xA; - Magnetometer - Magnetic Sensor: +/- 4/8/12/16   &#xD;&#xA; - Gauss Barometer: 260 – 1260 hPa absolute range (accuracy depends on the temperature and pressure, +/- 0.1 hPa under normal conditions)   &#xD;&#xA; - Temperature sensor (Temperature accurate to +/- 2 degC in the 0-65 degC range)   &#xD;&#xA; - Relative Humidity sensor (accurate to +/- 4.5% in the 20-80%rH range, accurate to +/- 0.5 degC in 15-40 degC range)    &#xD;&#xA; - 8x8 RGB LED matrix display   &#xD;&#xA; - Small 5 button joystick&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][12]][12]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That will allow you gather some data and report it to your server. You might be able to find a free service online to receive and display your data. I have seen some on other S.O site, but forget where.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But, you probably want to code your won server. I would recommend PHP as programming language. For Linux, you are well provided with [LAMP][13] (Linux, Apache, Mysql &amp; PHP). For Windows, you have to install a [WAMP][14] (Windows … etc). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can take your pick. I have used [XAMPP][15] in industrial applications for over a decade. You don’t ***have*** to use Mysql, Sqlite can serve just as well (shaless plug for my own S.O question of 6 years ago, “[**Sqlite or MySql? How to decide?**][16]“). You will also have to learn about [CRUD][17].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Based on the data received from the client/sensor, you might want to send a command back, even just a simple (display : &quot;temperature too high&quot;, which might translate to closing a valve in an industrial system).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You might want to raise alarms in real time (send email saying that the temperature is too high).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And, you might also want to think about generating reports. Start with a table showing data  received. The consider a chart, or something fancier. Add an option to export to [Comma Separated Values][18] (CSV) which allows the end user to import the data into a spreadsheet for further analysis and manipulation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you ***do*** decide that you want fancy reporting, you ***can*** do it in PHP, but, after a few decades of that I have now moved to doing much of the report stuff client side, in the browser. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For generally principles, get an overview of  [Single Page Application][19]s and [AJAX][20]. I, personally, did a lot of research and chose Google’s [AngularJS][21] as my programming language (there are lots of [tutorials][22] &amp; great support), but you are free to use plain JS, Jquery, etc, as you please.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you do decide to code browser stuff too, and you might be as well to use [NodeJs][23] on the server side, so that you only have to learn one new programing language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Too many choices? Sorry :-(&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope that this has given you some advice, but feel free to ask questions, and let me know if there is any general advice missing here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[ToDo] &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - bring more structure to this&#xD;&#xA; - add a [TL;DR][24] at the top&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/BBfp3.png&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: https://cordova.apache.org/&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: https://www.raspberrypi.org/&#xD;&#xA;  [10]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z3816.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [11]: https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Sense-HAT-AstroPi/dp/B014HDG74S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486637391&#xD;&#xA;  [12]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/4HV7H.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [13]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29&#xD;&#xA;  [14]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29#WAMP&#xD;&#xA;  [15]: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html&#xD;&#xA;  [16]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4813890/sqlite-or-mysql-how-to-decide&#xD;&#xA;  [17]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete&#xD;&#xA;  [18]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values&#xD;&#xA;  [19]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application&#xD;&#xA;  [20]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29&#xD;&#xA;  [21]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS&#xD;&#xA;  [22]: http://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_intro.asp&#xD;&#xA;  [23]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js&#xD;&#xA;  [24]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TL;DR" />

Instead, out-of-home requests need to be proxied through a server reached by outbound connections from both the phone and the IoT device.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- If the user is at home, but their phone is presently on a mobile network rather than their home network, then the above issue still applies.  Asking the user to switch their phone from mobile to wifi may or may not be acceptable to different users and depends to some degree on their phone's wifi battery usage; also some phones choose between both dynamically in a way that may be problematic if you require the wifi network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Connection between the phone and device by some other method like BTLE can be an advantage, but is range limited so may not work in all parts of the home or surrounding property, and obviously will not work when away from home.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So while you can build a device that doesn't *require* the support of out-of-home server infrastructure, it's probably better to build a device that can *make effect use of a relay server*, if reachable or allowed by user preference settings.

Amazon have [a little bit of guidance](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/x509-certs.html) about how you should secure your certificates, so I'll quote that here:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Certificates enable asymmetric keys to be used with devices. This means you can burn private keys into secure storage on a device without ever allowing the sensitive cryptographic material to leave the device.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since you're currently using the STM32's [Read Out Protection](http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/application_note/b4/14/62/81/18/57/48/05/DM00075930.pdf/files/DM00075930.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.DM00075930.pdf) (RDP), all but the most determined attackers will have trouble accessing your certificates in your current scheme:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The global Read Out Protection allows the embedded firmware code (preloaded in the Flash memory) to protect against reverse engineering, dumping using debug tools or other means of intrusive attack.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Level 0 - No protection (default)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Level 1 - Flash memory is protected against reading by debugging or code dumping&#xD;&#xA;by the RAM loaded code&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Level 2 - All debug features are disabled&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Is external storage going to be secure?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**It probably isn't *as* secure**. If your client's private key is stolen, an attacker can send data that appears to be from your device, when it actually isn't. Although it's not clear what data you're sending, any untrusted data can be a security risk.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Which bits do I need to keep private?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you create a device certificate on AWS IoT, you should see an image like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![AWS IoT](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/images/certificate-created.png)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/images/certificate-created.png)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;Image from the [*Create and Activate a Device Certificate*](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/create-device-certificate.html) page of the AWS IoT documentation.&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The private key is the thing you really need to keep... *private*, and should definitely be stored on the read-protected memory if possible. The public key and certificate are designed to be shared, so if you're running out of space, you can safely move those to external storage. You can get a little bit more context on the page [*How does SSL/TLS work?*](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/20803/how-does-ssl-tls-work) at Information Security Stack Exchange and [*Public-key cryptography*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) on Wikipedia. I think I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't include this image to explain *why* the private key needs to be secret:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Public key cryptography](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Public_key_encryption.svg/525px-Public_key_encryption.svg.png)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Public_key_encryption.svg/525px-Public_key_encryption.svg.png).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;Image from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography#/media/File:Public_key_encryption.svg), released into the public domain.&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your device's **public key** is what AWS IoT uses to sign messages to send to your device (but it **does not prove who is sending the message**). So, really, it's not a huge disaster if someone steals the public key, because it's not meant to be a secret.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The **private key** is what your device uses to decrypt messages, so it's a slightly bigger problem if an attacker steals this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You also asked what would happen if the attacker stole the RootCA certificate. If someone stole **AWS IoT's private key**, it would be disastrous, but the RootCA certificate on your device **isn't that**. The `RootCA.crt` that Amazon give you is [completely public](https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/verisign/roots/VeriSign-Class%203-Public-Primary-Certification-Authority-G5.pem), and the purpose is so that you can verify that you're not being attacked in any way (most likely a man-in-the-middle pretending to be AWS IoT's servers).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## What damage could a hacked device do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your stolen device can only perform the actions listed [in the policy](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/attach-iot-policy.html). Try to follow the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege); only grant your device the privileges it **absolutely needs**, so if the worst does happen, it can't wreak havoc too much. For your specific case:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The thing is allowed to publish to only 2 channels (its name and a data feed channel) which is connected to a data processor which will ignore any rogue packets coming to it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's good. Any attack should be isolated to just the two MQTT topics that the device can publish to, so it won't cause large scale harm." />

This key identifies your device. Anybody who can access that key can impersonate the device. That means that they can, in particular:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    * Publish valid, but incorrect data on the channels that your device is legitimately authorized to publish to.&#xD;&#xA;    * Publish invalid data that will get the legitimate device banned.&#xD;&#xA;    * Possibly, depending on the use case, expose some private information of the owner of the device.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; This private key had better remain confidential.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Your device probably has at least one *public* key, which allow it to recognize which servers it's talking to. It's ok if anybody can read this key: it's public. But an attacker should not be able to modify the key. Otherwise, they could communicate with the device and impersonate the server. This could allow them to do things like:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    * Push a firmware update to the device.&#xD;&#xA;    * Push a configuration update to the device.&#xD;&#xA;    * Make the device upload its data to a different location.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The good news is that this threat analysis is actually not very relevant. **You do not need to sacrifice any security**! (At least not confidentiality and authenticity properties — if you store stuff externally, then availability takes a hit, because that's one piece of the system that could go missing.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As long as you have at least 128 bits of storage that you can write to at least once, which you have and more, you can implement a secure remote storage solution. Use the limited-space on-device storage to store a secret key. This secret key must be unique per device; the STM32 has a hardware RNG, so you can generate it on the device during first boot. If your device didn't have a hardware RNG, you could generate the key in a secure off-device location and inject it onto the device.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With this key, use **[authenticated encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption)** for things that you store off the device. When you want to read some data from external storage, load it, decrypt-and-verify it. When you want to write some data to external storage, encrypt-and-sign it. This guarantees that the data is as confidential and authentic as the data in the internal storage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Authenticated encryption is enough to guarantee the confidentiality and *authenticity* of the data, but it doesn't quite guarantee its *integrity*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If there's more than one chunk of data, then when the device reads back a chunk of data, it can't be sure that this is the correct chunk. Solution: include a unique identifier in the content of each chunk (e.g. start each chunk with one of `&quot;AWS-IoT private key.&quot;`, `&quot;configuration CA certificate.&quot;`, `&quot;publishing server CA certificate.&quot;`, `&quot;user personal data.&quot;`, …).&#xD;&#xA;* If you update the data at some point, then when you read it back, you can't be sure that you're getting the latest version of that data. If someone can modify the external storage, they can't put fake data because that would fail the authenticity check, but they can restore old data, because what used to be authentic is still authentic. Solution: in each data chunk that is stored externally, include a counter which you increment each time you write a new version of that chunk. When you read a chunk back, verify that it's the expected version.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To avoid bricking a device in case the external storage is damaged or otherwise lost, in the limited space you have space on internal storage, you should give priority to whatever is needed to reset the device to a “good” state, e.g. a factory reset. The second priority will be performance considerations.&#xD;&#xA;" />

You can implement a cryptographically secure random generator if you have two things: some rewritable secure storage, and an initial seed. That is, it's enough to seed the RNG once, and then save its state and work off the saved state. It isn't ideal, it would be better to mix in entropy periodically, but it's ok, especially for a development protoype.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You do need to have rewritable secure storage. If the device only has ROM and non-secure storage, then this approach is not possible. There must be a location where you can store the RNG state in such a way that your adversaries can neither read it nor modify it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The way this works is, when the device boots, it loads the current RNG state, and uses it to generate some enough random bytes for twice the size of the RNG state. Write the first half as the new saved RNG state, and use the second half as the initial RNG state for the current session. With any cryptographically secure PRNG, this yields a cryptographically secure PRNG. Note that it's critical that you don't reuse a stored RNG state, that's why you must write a new independent RNG state before you start using the RNG.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The initial entropy injection can happen during manufacturing, or when the device is set up.

Often, though, a router reset will wipe this cache and start assigning IPs on a first-come, first-served basis. Tons of older routers don’t even have this ability, and immediately assign new IP addresses.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's obviously not great if you want a static local IP for Home Assistant to use. If your router doesn't remember which IP was assigned to each device, you can usually configure this using a **DHCP reservation** option, which will usually consist of adding the MAC address and desired static IP to a list for your router to use when assigning IPs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You're probably wondering, though - **how can I get the MAC address of my devices anyway?** Your router almost certainly has a list of devices connected, their local IPs and MAC addresses, as shown in [this answer](http://superuser.com/a/769812/655923) (although the exact method of viewing this again depends on your router).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'll update this with device-specific instructions when you include the router model in your answer, but I think these general steps should be enough to help anyone with a similar problem.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Not just the link-layer, but some of the security aspects of the protocol too. So this would easily be able to interface to a GSM module through a UART, without needing a further processing device. Building the radio stand-alone would actually be harder than having it tightly integrated with a control processor. You should also be wary of trying to use the asic directly on your own board - using a module removes the challenge of RF layout and type approval." />

When the &quot;host&quot; device is powered on and current is flowing, the &quot;parasite&quot; on the power cord would become powered--not much, obviously. But, perhaps enough to periodically send a wireless &quot;ping&quot; with an ID (like a MAC address) to some receiver. What this would get you is a sensor that would tell you whenever &quot;dumb&quot; devices were switched on. Based on the frequency of the pings, you might even be able to infer how much power the dumb device was using.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since the mechanism would be simple and inexpensive, and require no regulatory approval for plugging into mains power (UL/CE etc.) possibly someone could sell these in packs for a target price of ~$5 each. When you get enough of them (which would be the point to have a lot), a machine learning system could learn things about your habits: The hair dryer is on, it's probably ~30 minutes to bedtime. The coffee machine is on, turn on the radio...that sort of thing. And you don't have to buy a smart hair dryer or coffee machine that costs 30-40 times as much as a $5 sensor just to get that usage data." />

But you have to consider that the energy you harvest comes from somewhere. If you want to harvest some heat from your room heating elements, you must be aware that all the heat converted to electricity via your device will not heat the room. So, your room heater will have to consume more electricity if you want to keep your room as comfy as it used to be before you set up your heat harvester. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Take heat from devices where heat is wasted (i.e. any object whose main role is not to heat, like computers of servers as said above) seems to be more in the spirit of what you want to achieve.&#xD;&#xA; - In a Gaston-Lagaffe-style, you can set up small devices on doors, stairs etc...to create energy every time you pass by. An idea among others, you can set up a small dynamo at the top of your stairs, and every time you go down you grab a nylon-cord and run the dynamo. Once downstair, you let go the cord and it rewinds. The nylon cord will run for about 20m if your stairs are 10m long, so with a good gear ratio and efficient dynamo you can generate the amount of power you need for any small device around." />

It boils down to simply controlling 2 buttons.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First easy solution:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Setup a NodeJS server on my Raspberry Pi.&#xD;&#xA; 2. I plug my Raspberry GPIOs to 2 transistors, to control the coffee machine buttons&#xD;&#xA; 3. I can control the Raspberry GPIO directly in Javascript. For example&#xD;&#xA;    calling http://myraspberrypi.com/makemeacoffee activates the GPIO,&#xD;&#xA;    activates the buttons, and the coffee flows&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But: **I don't want to plug my raspberry to my coffee machine** (I need the Pi for other purposes), and I think that decoupling the web server and the controller itself is a good idea. If tomorrow I want to monitor the temperature of my bathroom, or control a second coffee machine (using another ESP8266) I want be able to do it without rethinking the whole thing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What I need to archive that is an ESP8266 with NodeMCU to use it as a Wi-Fi headless controller (see [this link][1]). Raspberry GPIO are no longer used (that's the point). There is only a NodeJS web server on the Pi.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here is a quick sketch of the architecture: &#xD;&#xA;[![is this architecture feasible ?][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let me clarify the role of the main components: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Raspberry Pi: Hosts the NodeJS web server&#xD;&#xA; - NodeJS web server: Serves the web pages to the end user. Basically a&#xD;&#xA;   page with a button &quot;Make me a coffee&quot;. Behind the scene, we need&#xD;&#xA;   &quot;push&quot; the heat up the water button, wait 30 sec, &quot;push&quot; the coffee&#xD;&#xA;   button. The web server does so by sending HTTP requests to the&#xD;&#xA;   ESP8266 (over Wi-Fi). The NodeJS server also does logging and data analysis (how many coffee did you drink this year ?)&#xD;&#xA; - ESP8266: Uses NodeMCU. Its GPIOs are plugged to a transistor&#xD;&#xA;   controlling the coffee machine buttons. I don't care about how to&#xD;&#xA;   power the ESP8266.

Once the heat up process ends, the coffee starts flowing. If there is not enough water, it ends and a LED blinks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The progress I expect : &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Version 1.0 will be &quot;Just run the coffee machine, I am sure it's&#xD;&#xA;   ready&quot;. I control the single cup button and the heat up button.&#xD;&#xA; - Version 2.0 will be &quot;Run the machine and give me feedback&quot; I had&#xD;&#xA;   another ESP8266, plugged to the feedback LED (So that I can know when&#xD;&#xA;   it's heating up and when it's out of water) and another one to a&#xD;&#xA;   scale to make sure the cup is there before running the coffee&#xD;&#xA;   machine. I might also add an alert when the coffee machine is ran to&#xD;&#xA;   tell the user to change the pod.&#xD;&#xA; - Version 3.0 will be to find a way to tell if the pod has been&#xD;&#xA;   changed, by tracking the opening of the mechanism with some kind of&#xD;&#xA;   switch. But this is out of the scope of my project at the moment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.instructables.com/id/ESP8266-Web-Server-Without-Arduino/ &quot;this link&quot;&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/qHkhc.png" />

You could get some energy between hot water pipes and cold water pipes--but then you're just making your water heater work harder--might as well just use mains power and pay for it directly.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, if you exploit the energy differential between a wastewater pipe (suppose somebody's taking a hot shower or draining pasta) and a cold pipe, then your cold water gets slightly warmer, and your wastewater gets slightly cooler--neither of these are likely to be a problem (unless the specific cold pipe you're using feeds into your refrigerator)." />

There also seem to be some companies that are intent on leveraging their XML knowledge to try to find yet another application area for this data representation system.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, not everyone is convinced that XML is the answer to everything in messaging systems. For example, there's been a noticeable shift in recent years to online systems that use JSON as a way to serialize data rather than XML, and if I put my developer hat on for a moment I would say that the tools to encode/decode from native representation (e.g. in Python, PHP, Javascript) seem a lot easier to use than for JSON than their equivalents for XML, even if XML has had more time to get those answers right. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;XML is a difficult representation for computers to handle, as it needs a relatively complex text parser, and then some kind of hierarchical representation to allow its data to be extracted in a program. Because there's so much text involved, you need quite a bit of memory available for encoding/decoding. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Often it seems unclear that XML is adding much value to the representation of the data: if the core message is not deeply hierarchical, then adding a lot of textual chaff seems unnecessary, but paradoxically if there is a lot of hierarchy then decoding the message from its textual representation is going to be hard work and need a lot of resources. Also, the benefit of representing in text are not clear to me: When we first write and debug communication systems it is common to use monitoring/decoding tools (for example Wireshark) to help us to figure out what is going wrong. In the long term, everything is working fine, and no human will need to look in detail at the messages going back and forth (only computers). Computers prefer binary representation. The textual representation benefits no-one involved at any stage of deployment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;XML is hard for humans to read (and manually construct) while being hard work for computers at the same time; It is therefore a system that is neither suitable for computers and nor is it suitable for humans.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Importantly, IoT has some special constraints that make it desirable to be efficient.  IoT devices will typically have limited processing power and storage (usually no large scale secondary storage, only some RAM and EEPROM). An IoT device might have the simplest possible communication links, maybe not even a TCP/IP stack. There will be a wide variety of microcontroller designs, not even at the level of sophistication where a standard operating system (e.g. Linux, Android) would be in use; this limits the number of off-the-shelf tools that will be lying around offering easy XML interfaces to use.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In summary, I suspect that with IoT, data representation is better left on a case-by-case basis, depending on hardware constraints, style of communication (e.g. broadcast, datagram, reliable etc), frequency of communication and so on. XML certainly shouldn't be thought of as a *sine qua non* for IoT.&#xD;&#xA;" />

For example calling http://myraspberrypi.com/makemeacoffee activates the GPIO, activates the buttons, and the coffee flows&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But: **I don't want to plug my raspberry to my coffee machine** (I need the Pi for other purposes), and I think that decoupling the web server and the controller itself is a good idea. If tomorrow I want to monitor the temperature of my bathroom, or control a second coffee machine (using another ESP8266) I want be able to do it without rethinking the whole thing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What I need to archive that is an ESP8266 with NodeMCU to use it as a Wi-Fi headless controller (see [this link][1]). Raspberry GPIO are no longer used (that's the point). There is only a NodeJS web server on the Pi.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here is a quick sketch of the architecture: &#xD;&#xA;[![is this architecture feasible ?][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let me clarify the role of the main components: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Raspberry Pi: Hosts the NodeJS web server&#xD;&#xA; - NodeJS web server: Serves the web pages to the end user. Basically a page with a button &quot;Make me a coffee&quot;. Behind the scene, we need to &quot;push&quot; the heat up the water button, wait 30 sec, then &quot;push&quot; the coffee button. The web server does so by sending HTTP requests to the  ESP8266 (over Wi-Fi). The NodeJS server also does logging and data analysis (how many coffee did you drink this year ?)&#xD;&#xA; - ESP8266: Uses NodeMCU. Its GPIOs are plugged to a transistor controlling the coffee machine buttons. I don't care about how to power the ESP8266. It runs a web server to listen to the Raspberry Pi requests and do actions on GPIOs accordingly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Is this architecture feasible?&#xD;&#xA;Is this architecture flexible?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;EDIT, to answer Sean Houlihane (spoiler to keep the post relatively short):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not 100% sure about this, but a transistor is seems to be enough. The coffee machine switch is working on low voltage (3,3V) and the ESP8266 won't share the ground with the coffee machine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;About the temperature sensing, and the water level control, the Senseo coffee machine has this built-in. &#xD;&#xA;Typical use : Press the center button to launch the heat up process, choose your coffee size by pressing the &quot;single&quot; or &quot;double&quot; button. Once the heat up process ends, the coffee starts flowing. If there is not enough water, it ends and a LED blinks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The progress I expect : &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Version 1.0 will be &quot;Just run the coffee machine, I am sure it's  ready&quot;. I control the single cup button and the heat up button.&#xD;&#xA; - Version 2.0 will be &quot;Run the machine and give me feedback&quot; I had another ESP8266, plugged to the feedback LED (So that I can know when it's heating up and when it's out of water) and another one to a scale to make sure the cup is there before running the coffee machine. I might also add an alert when the coffee machine is ran to tell the user to change the pod.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Version 3.0 will be to find a way to tell if the pod has been changed, by tracking the opening of the mechanism with some kind of switch. But this is out of the scope of my project at the moment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.instructables.com/id/ESP8266-Web-Server-Without-Arduino/ &quot;this link&quot;&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/qHkhc.png" />

Energy harvesting from thermal&#xD;&#xA;sources such as body heat and mechanical sources such&#xD;&#xA;as human motion have been proposed. There are also sensor&#xD;&#xA;network systems that harvest energy from the visible part of&#xD;&#xA;the electromagnetic spectrum. However, ambient light levels&#xD;&#xA;in indoor environments are typically significantly lower&#xD;&#xA;than those found outdoors and highly dependent on the nature&#xD;&#xA;of the indoor environment considered. Recently, lowpower&#xD;&#xA;clock synchronization using electromagnetic energy&#xD;&#xA;radiating from AC power lines was proposed. In this paper,&#xD;&#xA;we go a step ahead and try to answer the question: Can energy&#xD;&#xA;be harvested from the electromagnetic energy radiating&#xD;&#xA;from AC power lines and use it to operate a wireless sensor&#xD;&#xA;network with a low duty-cycle? We find that such energy&#xD;&#xA;harvesting appears promising." />

[...] The use of a geo-fence is called geo-fencing, and one example of usage involves a location-aware device of a location-based service (LBS) user entering or exiting a geo-fence. This activity could trigger an alert to the device's user as well as messaging to the geo-fence operator. This info, which could contain the location of the device, could be sent to a mobile telephone or an email account.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are various ways that you can implement this, depending on what sort of device you use and how much code you're willing to write:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [How-To Geek](https://www.howtogeek.com/221555/how-to-create-geographic-event-triggers-with-your-smartphone-and-ifttt/) has an article on how to use geo-fencing with IFTTT. You could then connect that to something like the Maker channel, which can send POST requests to your garage door.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [Android also provides a geo-fencing API](https://developer.android.com/training/location/geofencing.html) which you could use if you were so inclined. This would be far more involved than using IFTTT, though.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, this answer neglects the other side of the question: how do you make the garage door open when it receives a message? That aspect would probably be best addressed in a different question, but if you used the IFTTT Maker channel to send a request, you would need to have some sort of networking capability on the device that opens the door. Your current door opener is probably not that advanced if it just uses an infrared detector, so custom hardware might be needed.&#xD;&#xA;" />

The options for receivers/transmitters are either:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - a dedicated and/or proprietary receiver unit, which allows the manufacturer to select optimised frequencies, protocols and technologies, but which means you need to bring out that receiver when you need to find your keys.&#xD;&#xA; - use the smartphone which you already carry as the receiver. That makes the solution a lot cheaper, you only have to buy beacons, but also limits the beacon manufacturer to technologies, frequencies and protocols that are commonly implemented on smartphones.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The advantage of **passive beacons** is that they're likely to be quite reliable and cheap to manufacture, the expense is in a transmitter/receiver combo that works from a reasonable distance. Most likely you'll need special purpose device to take the role of tranmitter/receiver as smartphones currently only support  NFC as a passively powered protocol,  **near**-field communication with a range of a couple of cm.  &#xD;&#xA;An example that works over significant distances would be the [Recco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RECCO) beacons and receivers marketed for finding people buried by avalanches. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For **active beacons** the main issue is power consumption. As you listed there are a number of different protocols and solutions that are low powered and energy efficient, but since nobody really seems to want to depend on separate receivers but would rather use a smartphone effectively that means either Bluetooth or WiFi.  &#xD;&#xA; As currently phones can only be connected to one WiFi network at the time and when operating as a hotspot can't be connected to another WiFI network at all, that is probably not the most desirable protocol.  &#xD;&#xA;With Bluetooth 4 and above on the other hand  a large number of devices can be connected simultaneously and that standard also comes with the [Bluetooth low energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_low_energy) variant. You also get a reasonable distance from Bluetooth. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

For the light 1V = to a dark room and 3.3V = daylight or direct lamp light. I could go all the way to try to convert these figures to Lux but it doesn't really make any difference since all I want is to know the relative level of light (or sound).

The options for receivers/transmitters are either:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - a dedicated and/or proprietary receiver unit, which allows the manufacturer to select optimised frequencies, protocols and technologies, but which means you need to bring out that receiver when you need to find your keys.&#xD;&#xA; - use the smartphone which you already carry as the receiver. That makes the solution a lot cheaper, you only have to buy beacons, but also limits the beacon manufacturer to technologies, frequencies and protocols that are commonly implemented on smartphones.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The advantage of **passive beacons** is that they're likely to be quite reliable and cheap to manufacture, the expense is in a transmitter/receiver combo that works from a reasonable distance. Most likely you'll need special purpose device to take the role of tranmitter/receiver as smartphones currently only support  NFC as a passively powered protocol,  **near**-field communication with a range of a couple of cm.  &#xD;&#xA;An example that works over significant distances would be the [Recco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RECCO) beacons and receivers marketed for finding people buried by avalanches. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For **active beacons** the main issue is power consumption. As you listed there are a number of different protocols and solutions that are low powered and energy efficient, but since nobody really seems to want to depend on separate receivers but would rather use a smartphone effectively that means either Bluetooth or WiFi.  &#xD;&#xA; As currently phones can only be connected to one WiFi network at the time and when operating as a hotspot can't be connected to another WiFI network at all, that is probably not the most desirable protocol.  &#xD;&#xA;With Bluetooth 4 and above on the other hand  a large number of devices can be connected simultaneously and that standard also comes with the [Bluetooth low energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_low_energy) variant. You also get a reasonable distance from Bluetooth. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; So should we stay on BT beacons or can other protocols be more reliable especially for home usage?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**In summary:** unless you are willing to use a specific receiver to find your beacon Bluetooth Low Energy is the best choice.

Alexa hasn’t supported the ability to provide any kind of audio notice unprompted as a result of data it receives from a user’s connected services – the closest it comes is being able to sound an alert based on an alarm or timer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A second citation comes from [Consumerist](https://consumerist.com/2016/09/12/amazons-alexa-may-get-the-ability-to-talk-without-being-spoken-to-first/):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;As it stands right now, Amazon Echo is the well-behaved child your grandparents might have approved of: it doesn’t speak until spoken to.

On Kinetis devices, the flash&#xD;&#xA;&gt; swap system monitors/controls all the steps of switching from the old&#xD;&#xA;&gt; application to new; there is an added assurance of reliable operation&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in the case of a power loss during one of those steps.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Advantages &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Ease of programming. Application always executes out of the lower&#xD;&#xA;&gt; block in the memory map.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; -  Power loss tolerant.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; -  No bootloader&#xD;&#xA;&gt; required. No delay to the start of the main application.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; -  Well&#xD;&#xA;&gt; suited for a multi-tasking OS. Minimal application downtime. In a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; multi-tasking system it is possible to continue to execute the main&#xD;&#xA;&gt; application tasks while background tasks are running to update the new&#xD;&#xA;&gt; copy of the application.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; -  Backup copy of code. Possible to revert to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the known working application.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Disadvantages&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; -  Additional flash&#xD;&#xA;&gt; memory space required to store backup copy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can update blocks and then swap them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![memory swap during update visualized][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The document linked holds detailed description.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It ensures safer firmware upgrades but as it requires more flash memroy, certainly **costs more**. Also **not applicable** for any type of microcontroller, only those which support internal flash blocks swap.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://cache.freescale.com/files/microcontrollers/doc/app_note/AN4533.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/3xkYH.png" />

That limits the lengths of the wake word due to obvious processing limitations. Furthermore users don't want to recite a poem to activate the smart assistant. Thus, ***it has to be short.***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It has to work with an almost 100% accuracy when called and also *not recognized* with that certainty when not called for. That makes problems and also makes for a ***minimum length for wake words.*** Amazon's choice to allow *Echo* is quite surprising since it's just two [syllables][3].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we look at the usual suspects, we have *Alexa (3 syllables), Amazon (3), Echo (2), Ok Google (4), Hey Cortana (4),* and *Hey Siri (3).* All industry giants almost agree on three being a good choice number of syllables.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Strangely enough the most wanted wake word *&quot;computer&quot;* has also three syllables and would match that requirement easily.

That’s the intro out of the way.

The sensor will output: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The  4-20  mA  vibration   transmitters  are  piezo-electric  accelerometers  of  compression  type   and provide  a   4-20 mA output  signal  proportional to the true RMS value of vibration velocity. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So the output of this sensor is a **current** signal between 4 mA and 20 mA (**not** a voltage) that is proportional to the RMS value of vibration velocity. To read this sensors output the current will have to be converted to a voltage using a [transimpedance amplifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transimpedance_amplifier) (current-to-voltage converter) or measuring the voltage drop acros a well defined series resistor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However as the sensor output is the [true RMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square) value of vibrations in the specified frequency range (2..10,000 Hz) it is not possible to obtain the frequency (or to be more precise the wide frequency band) of the vibration with this sensor. To detect the frequency spectrum a measurement of the time waveform of the vibration amplitudes would be necessary.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This [booklet about vibration measurement](https://www.bksv.com/media/doc/br0094.pdf) gives some more insight.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The RMS value is typically used in quantifying the vibration level:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The    RMS   value   is   the   most   relevant   measure   of   amplitude   because   it   both   takes   the   time   history   of   the   wave   into   account   and   gives   an   amplitude   value   which   is   directly    related    to    the    energy    content,    and    therefore    the destructive abilities of  the vibration. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The purpose of this sensor seems to be for monitoring of machinery where the actual time waveform of the vibration is of little interest. A single value (the RMS value) is sufficient to monitor the operation of the machine against a threshold value. It significantly simplifies measurement.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Experience   has   shown   that   the   overall   RMS   value   of   vibration   velocity   measured   over   the   range   10   to   1000   Hz gives   the   best   indication   of   a   vibration's   severity.   A probable    explanation    is    that    a    given    velocity    level    corresponds   to   a   given   energy   level   so   that   vibration   at   low and   high   frequencies   are   equally   weighted   from   a vibration    energy    point    of    view.    In    practice    many    machines   have a reasonably flat velocity spectrum. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

For instance, Zigbee is governed by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These standards lay down the messages to be transmitted and define that byte 0 means this, bytes 1 through 4 mean that, etc, so that devices from disparate manufactures can communicate with each other (that’s the theory, anyway; I could tell you some horror stories ;-)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I said, for any given protocol, there can be a plethora of manufactures. And for any given manufacturer, there can be multiple software libraries, which is your problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your task is too difficult as long as there are multiple APIS available, which wrap each protocol. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sadly, there will only be a Posix-like API only if one company becomes dominant.

You do say that, sort of, but not explicitly enough, IMO. When you define that exactly, you will know what your project really is.  If you already know, you don’t seem to emphasize it (but maybe I am not reading well enough, rushed between two meetings).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The syntax of POSIX APIs is policed by the compiler, as will be the syntax of any APIs which you study.

Consider that to make things happen, you need rules to exist. If you want to push a big red button to open a garage door, some rule has to tie the sensor (button) to the desired action (opening the door). There are two ways to make that happen: you can put the rule directly in the button, or you can put the rule in a separate computer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's think more about the direct solution. If you teach the button about the garage door, then your button holds the rules internally.  It can't do anything else unless you reprogram it.  If you want the garage door to open, and 5 minutes later close, your button needs all the complexities of a real time clock.  Your button won't know the state of the door, making it hard to know if you're closing the door or opening it.  And how do you back up the rules so that if your button breaks, your replacement button can do the job?  On the plus side, it's cheap: you don't need a separate computer.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With a controller, things are different. All messages from all sensors are delivered to the controller.  The controller can apply whatever inputs are needed to very complex rules: it can check the sunshine sensor and not turn on the outdoor lights unless it's dark, or not run the sprinklers if the average rainfall for the month is above average and the current temperature is five degrees below average.  The controller can keep track of state.  This could be important if you want a &quot;close garage door&quot; button but not an &quot;open garage door&quot; button (when I'm away from home, I rarely want to open the door, but I definitely want to close it if it is accidentally left open.)  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The controller can also have more complex logic for seemingly simple tasks such as delivering messages by offering certain levels of service.  For example, the MQTT protocol allows for three different levels: try to deliver the message once, deliver it repeatedly until it's been seen at least once, or deliver it once and only once.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The controller also offers a way to consolidate all messaging to and from a communication gateway, allowing the use of an external interface.  It also provides a single point to back up all the rules for your system.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The downsides to the controller are added latency and extra complexity.  Surprisingly, a controller doesn't make the cost go up appreciably.  You can implement a controller on a Raspberry Pi for less than the cost of one average remotely controllable light switch.  Don't discount the idea on the basis of cost alone." />

Bonus for you, this may be a never-ending process:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - what about a smart temperature management? You can set up some heat sensor in various places, then connect them to a central server. Then, find a way to know when your heating device(s) is(are) on, and make your system learn how the temperature where sensors are reacts to heater on/off. Now, you can save your habits into your server (wake-up at 7am, leaving to work à 8:30, going back at 5pm etc...) and set each temperature you want when present/absent. The ultimate goal is to make your system start heating just when needed, to wake-up in a comfy environment at 7am and let the house getting cold when absent, etc... You may need to find a way for your server to activate each heating device&#xD;&#xA; - in addition to smart heating, you can set up automatic shutter opening and closing. Winter time? Open the shutter when sun is up to heat your house for free, and close them when sunset to not let any degree get away *via* your windows. Summer time? Reverse the principe: protect from external heat at day, ...&#xD;&#xA; - you can set up smart access to your home too, like an [automatic garage door](http://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/1060/automatically-open-a-garage-door-when-approaching-by-car)&#xD;&#xA; - and so on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To do so, you may have to:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. set up a server&#xD;&#xA; 2. create a link between it and every sensor/actuator in your house&#xD;&#xA; 3. create a client to monitor your house (temperature efficiency, time with shutters closed/open, etc...)&#xD;&#xA; 4. imagine algorithms for the smart heating part and for shutter commands (and internet requests for sunrise/sunset time)&#xD;&#xA; 5. make statistics and every data you want&#xD;&#xA; 6. take a look on [this question](http://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/1104/what-do-i-need-to-create-my-own-personal-cloud-for-iot-devices) for informations about how to store your data on the cloud&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What do you think about that?

This is roughly what happens with not properly constructed devices in outdoor environments, starting with a dry housing:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. The outdoor temperature rises. The temperature of the air in your device rises even more (especially when placed in the sun).&#xD;&#xA;2. Therefore, the air pressure in your device rises, it expands and some part diffuses out of the device.&#xD;&#xA;3. The temperature falls. Thus humid (!) air diffuses back into the device. &#xD;&#xA;4. The humid air condensates inside the device.&#xD;&#xA;5. The cycle repeats, but the temperature inside the device is not high enough to evaporate the water again. Therefore, water accumulates inside the device. Every day a very tiny amount of water is added.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Several possible approaches to counteract this problem:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Sealing the device** Trust me, that does not work with household items. Even if your freezer box has a seal and silicone works good in the bathroom, both do not prevent the flow of humid air! Dipping the device into water without any water coming in, does not mean that humid air will stay out, too! If you want to go that way, buy industrial grade (IP rated) housings and do not drill additional holes into it!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Drilling a hole into the bottom** What, you just said the opposite? The reason is simple: If you can not avoid that humid air comes into your device, you should at least avoid that water accumulates inside. For many electronic components *some* humidity is not such a big problem, but accumulating water is!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Air-conditioning** Heating up the device prevents condensation. This is the common approach for large and sensitive outdoor devices, especially if the condensation itself induces problems (for example for optics).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **A pressure-compensating diaphragm** Not that cheap but work quite good in practice by equalizing the air pressures. There are also cable feed-throughs with an integrated diaphragm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## General Guidelines&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please do not waste your time and make the same mistake as hundreds of research groups (including ours) made before for decades and just throw some unspecific sensors into the wild without knowing what you really want to get in the end!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You should ask yourself the following question: Is it really the data itself that I want to collect or do I want to evaluate and develop network protocols etc.? The answer results in very distinct paths:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### I want to get the data!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In that case, try to rely on proven practices as much as you can. Buy standard hardware, use industrial grade housings, provide much more batteries than you think your hardware requires and monitor them! Use already existing and well-tested software and do not build everything from scratch! Even think about the following: Do I ***really*** need wireless connections?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, there are many applications where you really need hundreds of energy harvesting, wireless, self-organizing and tiny devices. But just using these techniques because they are **cool** is a waste of money and time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you really want to get the data, nothing is more frustrating than to notice that just for the most interesting day, no data is available because water has accumulated in your devices (been there, see above!).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Naah, I just want to play around with wireless networks!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In that case, really focus on the core. I talk about network protocols here, but it equally holds for all other procedures and algorithms in the IoT context.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For most protocols, it does not care if they transport real-world data or just some pseudo-random noise. So why not take the easy road, throw away your sensors and just generate some random data? I recommend the following procedure:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Think about which problem you want to solve. What is your research question?&#xD;&#xA;2. Read! Many things have been done already. Many concepts have been shown to be good, many others not. Starting with network protocols from scratch is just a waste of time.&#xD;&#xA;3. Do some theoretical evaluations. Is it really possible to improve a given protocol or is it already at a principle boundary? Shannon can not be fooled!&#xD;&#xA;4. Do simulations. I suggest the OMNeT++/INET framework, but there are many frameworks out there. But please do not start from scratch. Most components are already there for your convenience. Test if your ideas work in the controlled environment of a simulator.&#xD;&#xA;5. Work on the hardware implementation. Does your implementation work at least on your desk?&#xD;&#xA;6. Test it an already existing testbed. One example is the [FIT IoT-LAB][1].

Now you can finally plan your real-world deployment and tailor it to the specific problem that you want to address.

However, please consider these [general guidelines when planning a wireless sensor network][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is very simple to build a housing that keeps the rain from falling onto your sensor, but as @Ghanima pointed out it very much depends on what you really want to measure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, the main problem is not rain but humidity. This is roughly what happens with not properly constructed devices in outdoor environments, starting with a dry housing:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. The outdoor temperature rises. The temperature of the air in your device rises even more (especially when placed in the sun).&#xD;&#xA;2. Therefore, the air pressure in your device rises, it expands and some part diffuses out of the device.&#xD;&#xA;3. The temperature falls. Thus humid (!) air diffuses back into the device. &#xD;&#xA;4. The humid air condensates inside the device.&#xD;&#xA;5. The cycle repeats, but the temperature inside the device is not high enough to evaporate the water again. Therefore, water accumulates inside the device. Every day a very tiny amount of water is added.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Several possible approaches to counteract this problem:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Sealing the device** Trust me, that does not work with household items. Even if your freezer box has a seal and silicone works good in the bathroom, both do not prevent the flow of humid air! Dipping the device into water without any water coming in, does not mean that humid air will stay out, too! If you want to go that way, buy industrial grade (IP rated) housings and do not drill additional holes into it!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Drilling a hole into the bottom** What, you just said the opposite? The reason is simple: If you can not avoid that humid air comes into your device, you should at least avoid that water accumulates inside. For many electronic components *some* humidity is not such a big problem, but accumulating water is!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Air-conditioning** Heating up the device prevents condensation. This is the common approach for large and sensitive outdoor devices, especially if the condensation itself induces problems (for example for optics).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **A pressure-compensating diaphragm** Not that cheap but works quite good in practice by equalizing the air pressures. There are also cable feed-throughs with an integrated diaphragm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/1115/what-should-be-considered-when-building-a-wireless-sensor-network/1116#1116" />

Then, find a way to know when your heating device(s) is(are) on, and make your system learn how the temperature where sensors are reacts to heater on/off.

To punch a hole, each client connects to an unrestricted third-party server that temporarily stores external and internal address and port information for each client. The server then relays each client's information to the other, and using that information each client tries to establish direct connection; as a result of the connections using valid port numbers, restrictive firewalls or routers accept and forward the incoming packets on each side.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation) on your router means that clients outside of your network can't connect to open ports of devices *inside* your network, but it doesn't restrict devices in your network from connecting to a 'broker'. Using [a little bit of indirection](http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/udp-hole-punching/), you can establish a direct connection between two devices without actually opening any ports - this is essentially what services like Skype and Hamachi do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, this does require an external server to co-ordinate the connection, and you would probably want to trust the server that was performing the hole punching.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[*Peer-to-Peer Communication Across Network Address Translators*](http://www.brynosaurus.com/pub/net/p2pnat/) by Bryan Ford, Pyda Srisuresh and Dan Kegel is an interesting read for more information on the mechanisms of hole punching and how reliable it is." />

Consider that to make things happen, you need rules to exist. If you want to push a big red button to open a garage door, some rule has to tie the sensor (button) to the desired action (opening the door). There are two ways to make that happen: you can put the rule directly in the button, or you can put the rule in a separate computer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's think more about the direct solution. If you teach the button about the garage door, then your button holds the rules internally.  The button needs the ID of the garage door, so if you replace the garage door, the button doesn't work.  If the button is on your desk, and your house uses a proprietary network, the button has to know both the address of your home's gateway and the address of the door.  The button can't do anything else unless you reprogram it - do you have a flash programmer for the button's chip laying around, and is that programmer compatible with any other devices?  If you want the garage door to open, and 5 minutes later close, your button needs all the complexities of maintaining a real-time clock.  Your button won't know the state of the door, making it hard to know if you're closing the door or opening it.  And how do you back up the rules so that if your button breaks, your replacement button can do the job?  On the plus side, it's cheap: you don't need a separate computer.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With a controller, things are different. All messages from all sensors are delivered to the controller.  Each sensor is simple: send the signal to the controller.  The controller can then apply whatever inputs are needed to very complex rules: it can check the sunshine sensor and not turn on the outdoor lights unless it's dark, or not run the sprinklers if the average rainfall for the month is above average and the current temperature is five degrees below average.  The controller can keep track of state.  This could be important if you want a &quot;close garage door&quot; button but not an &quot;open garage door&quot; button (when I'm away from home, I rarely want to open the door, but I definitely want to close it if it is accidentally left open.)  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The controller can also have more complex logic for seemingly simple infrastructure tasks such as delivering messages by offering certain levels of service.  For example, the MQTT protocol allows for three different levels: try to deliver the message once, deliver it repeatedly until it's been seen at least once, or deliver it once and only once.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The controller offers an architecturally logical place to consolidate all messaging to and from a communication gateway, allowing the use of an external interface.  This means your button and your phone can both send signals, and the rules can figure out that either one is allowed to open the garage door.  The gateway can also provide the security.  You don't have to put your button and your garage door on the internet; you can put them both on private isolated networks and use the gateway to carry the signals.  The controller also provides a single point to back up all the rules for your system.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The downsides to the controller are added latency and extra complexity.  Surprisingly, a controller doesn't make the cost go up appreciably.  You can implement a controller on a Raspberry Pi for less than the cost of one average remotely controllable light switch.  Don't discount the idea on the basis of cost alone." />

There are two ways to make that happen: you can put the rule directly in the button, or you can put the rule in a separate computer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Let's think more about the direct solution. If you teach the button about the garage door, then your button holds the rules internally.  The button needs the ID of the garage door, so if you replace the garage door, the button doesn't work.  If the button is on your desk, and your house uses a proprietary network, the button has to know both the address of your home's gateway and the address of the door.  The button needs to know the specific protocol to signal your door to open - do all manufacturers make compatible buttons that know about all door signals?  The button can't do anything else unless you reprogram it - do you have a flash programmer for the button's chip laying around, and is that programmer compatible with any other devices?  If you want the garage door to open, and 5 minutes later close, your button needs all the complexities of maintaining a real-time clock.  Your button won't know the state of the door, making it hard to know if you're closing the door or opening it.  And how do you back up the rules so that if your button breaks, your replacement button can do the job?  On the plus side, it sounds cheap: you don't need a separate computer.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With a controller, things are different. All messages from all sensors are delivered to the controller.  Each sensor is simple: send the signal to the controller.  The controller can then apply whatever inputs are needed to very complex rules: it can check the sunshine sensor and not turn on the outdoor lights unless it's dark, or not run the sprinklers if the average rainfall for the month is above average and the current temperature is five degrees below average.  The controller can keep track of state.  This could be important if you want a &quot;close garage door&quot; button but not an &quot;open garage door&quot; button (when I'm away from home, I rarely want to open the door, but I definitely want to close it if it is accidentally left open.)  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The controller can provide the place for device drivers that know how to listen to buttons and other drivers that know how to speak to doors.  The controller may be more upgradeable to new devices and device types than a tiny chip tucked inside a button.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The controller can also have more complex logic for infrastructure tasks such as delivering messages by offering certain levels of service.  For example, the MQTT protocol allows for three different levels: try to deliver the message once, deliver it repeatedly until it's been seen at least once, or deliver it once and only once.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The controller offers an architecturally logical place to consolidate all messaging to and from a communication gateway, allowing the use of an external interface.  This means your button and your phone can both send signals, and the rules can figure out that either one is allowed to open the garage door.  The gateway can also provide the security.  You don't have to put your button and your garage door on the internet; you can put them both on private isolated networks and use the gateway to carry the signals.  The controller also provides a single point to back up all the rules for your system.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The downsides to the controller are added latency and extra complexity.  Surprisingly, a controller doesn't make the cost go up appreciably.  You can implement a controller on a Raspberry Pi for less than the cost of one average remotely controllable light switch.  Don't discount the idea on the basis of cost alone." />

If the algorithm uses floating-point or runs on a GPU, it might not be possible to run on the embedded processor in the sensor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Even if it doesn't, if the algorithm was developed in a high-level language, it might be too expensive (in developer time) to port it to run on the sensor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Offloading computation from the sensor may increase its battery life (depending on how this affects network/radio use).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Running the algorithm in the cloud allows it to combine the data from many sensors and make a system-level decision. In this example, that might mean filtering across different cars' sensors, so that washing one car doesn't cause a rain warning in every car.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Processing in the cloud allows to distribute the information to many places without having to have a mesh network, which is a complicated architecture.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. You can log more data, which enables better analytics, audit, and development of better algorithms.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Benefits of processing on-board&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. If the raw sensor data is high-bandwidth, it might use less battery to summarise the data and send the summary (depending on what processing is needed to *summarise* it). This might mean that instead of sending an 8-bit moisture reading 100 times a second, you filter it and send a 1-bit wet/dry flag every 10 seconds.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. You might go further, and only wake up the network at all when the sensor has something interesting-looking to report (e.g. the wet/dry state changes)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Reducing the network bandwidth at the sensor end also reduces it at the server end, so you can scale the service to more users (more sensors) very cheaply.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. It might be possible to run the service with the same or reduced functionality even when the network is unavailable. In this example, your car might be able to warn you about slippery roads it sees itself, but not give you advance warning from other cars.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Overall&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Usually, some combination of the two is optimal. You might do as much processing as you can afford to do on the device, to reduce the need for the network as much as you can, and then run more sophisticated algorithms in the cloud that can combine more inputs or use more compute power.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You might start out running all of your processing in the cloud (because it was prototyped in Matlab or Python) and port parts gradually to Rust to enable offline functionality, when you have developer time to spend on it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You might process the data heavily on the device in normal use but also sample and log the raw data sometimes, so that you can upload it to the cloud later (when network is more available) for your analytics." />

It would make far more sense to *push* changes to the server when the piezo sensor detects a change.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's the difference between this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Server: *Is there someone at the door?*&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Sensor: ***No***.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Server: *Is there someone at the door?*&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Sensor: ***No***.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Server: *Is there someone at the door?*&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Sensor: ***No***.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; *... repeat ad infinitum ...*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Sensor: *There's someone at the door!*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first example is polling, and the second is pushing. You can tell which one will have lower power usage, less complex code and reduced network usage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## HTTP or Something Else?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An AJAX request is sent over HTTP, so it's quite heavyweight and requires several [TCP handshakes](http://www.inetdaemon.com/tutorials/internet/tcp/3-way_handshake.shtml) *per connection* (unless you use [Keep-Alive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_persistent_connection)). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It may be worth considering alternative protocols such as [MQTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT) (there's some good explanation in the question 'http://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/44/when-and-why-to-use-mqtt-protocol', which has a very similar problem to yours).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A message broker like MQTT might be a little bit more powerful than you really need in your current situation, but one MQTT broker could easily be expanded if you chose to add more devices to your smart home network, whereas your current system of AJAX requests would quickly fall apart. Imagine four or five different devices polling each other; it'd quickly lead to your network becoming overloaded and it would be a massive drain on power usage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Node and Web Sockets&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using web sockets and Node would solve the issue of using *push* instead of *poll*, so it would be a good idea in my opinion. **However**, I suspect polling would work if you really didn't want to learn Node.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want an **extensible solution** that will work when you expand your smart home, definitely go with pushing - it'll save a lot of trouble and tears. If you just want a quick proof of concept, polling will probably work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My personal advice is that you **should** either learn web sockets or investigate using a message broker like MQTT. You could use a client library like [Mosquitto-PHP](https://github.com/mgdm/Mosquitto-PHP) (with a [guide by HiveMQ](http://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-client-library-encyclopedia-mosquitto-php)) to simplify using MQTT in PHP, or just go with Node and web sockets.

This class would only define the functions your application code will use. Simple example functions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - connect&#xD;&#xA; - disconnect&#xD;&#xA; - send&#xD;&#xA; - receive&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This would be your base class from which you could inherit a Cellular and a Wi-Fi class to implement the actual `connect/disconnect/send/receive` functions. These functions would be different for Wi-Fi and Cellular under the hood but the interface will be the same, and the result would be the same: **Internet connection**. The caller class/code would not know if it is a Cellular or Wi-Fi connection, it would only know that there are `connect/disconnect/send/receive` functions to use and there are **Internet**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So when you do the testing you will have a Wi-Fi class instance and when you have finished debugging you could simply change it to a Cellular class instance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This way you do not have to rewrite your code based on the used communication method.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.esp8266.com/wiki/doku.php?id=esp8266-module-family&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/m4uR5.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://www.itead.cc/wiki/images/5/53/Esp8266_at_instruction_set_en_v1.5.4_0.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://espressif.com/en/support/download/documents&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://accu.org/index.php/journals/233" />

However, it won't notice if multiple people enter at once, so it's a rough estimate.  &#xD;&#xA;You've probably seen infrared motion detectors which work on a similar principle - they're frequently used on automatic doors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- for a closed area like a building, you could attach a sensor to the door and count how many times it is opened. Of course, this will also count how many times the door is opened when people *leave*, but halving the number should give you a rough estimate. Obviously, for open areas, this won't work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**If you want to actually monitor how many people are *in* an area...**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- you could use machine learning and computer vision (with a camera) to actually *count* how many people are in an area, as described in [*Lightweight people counting and localizing in indoor spaces using camera sensor nodes*](http://thiagot.com/papers/teixeira_icdsc07.pdf). This is going to be much more complex and probably more costly, but if you require accuracy, this might be the way to go. There are several commercial versions of this on the market, which you can find by searching for 'camera people counting' or something similar." />

EM Fields from AC wires behind wall (if mounted near an electrical wire) - https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~vikramg/docs/hotemnets11.pdf&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; Abstract - &#xD;&#xA;There has been considerable interest in energy harvesting&#xD;&#xA;for wireless sensor networks. Energy harvesting from thermal&#xD;&#xA;sources such as body heat and mechanical sources such&#xD;&#xA;as human motion have been proposed. There are also sensor&#xD;&#xA;network systems that harvest energy from the visible part of&#xD;&#xA;the electromagnetic spectrum. However, ambient light levels&#xD;&#xA;in indoor environments are typically significantly lower&#xD;&#xA;than those found outdoors and highly dependent on the nature&#xD;&#xA;of the indoor environment considered. Recently, lowpower&#xD;&#xA;clock synchronization using electromagnetic energy&#xD;&#xA;radiating from AC power lines was proposed. In this paper,&#xD;&#xA;we go a step ahead and try to answer the question: Can energy&#xD;&#xA;be harvested from the electromagnetic energy radiating&#xD;&#xA;from AC power lines and use it to operate a wireless sensor&#xD;&#xA;network with a low duty-cycle? We find that such energy&#xD;&#xA;harvesting appears promising." />

This is mainly because the distance at which BT LE operates severely limits the useful time to transmit data (devices with ranges of up to 200m have been demonstrated, but are unlikely to appear in the wild).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If your moving wheel is circling around the receiver, you'd be fine again (again with the antenna at the hub).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is all to prevent Doppler shift.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The frequency bands of BT are only 2MHz apart (channel 2: 2408MHz, channel 3: 2410MHz, ...), so once the frequency shift gets too large, you will run into problems. A transmitter on channel 3 in a car with a speed of at 200km/h (125mph) will appear to a non-moving observer to operate on channel 4 (when getting closer, head on) or channel 2 (when getting straight away). And a nice pitch-bend transition while it's zipping past.  As mentioned by Jim, BT was not designed for such scenarios.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Off-topic, but related: LTE (&quot;4G&quot;) will stop working at 200km/h." />

The first will be on the outside of the door jam, the second will be on the inside of the door jam.  This will accomplish several things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. It will determine the direction of traffic flow.  &#xD;&#xA;  - If the outside infrared beam is intercepted first and then the inside infrared beam is intercepted (probably simultaneously or with a 1 second delay tolerance, depending on the distance between the beams), you know that a person went into the room. &#xD;&#xA;   - If the inside infrared beam is intercepted first and then the outside infrared beam is intercepted (again, probably simultaneously or with a 1 second delay tolerance, depending on the distance between the beams), you know that a person went out of the room.&#xD;&#xA;   - If just one of the beams was intercepted, you know that something intercepted one of the beams, but never crossed the other, so net change is zero.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. If the door is narrow enough so that only one person can pass at a time comfortably, it will give you a reasonably accurate reading, because people rarely follow each other nose to toes.  Obviously, the more sensors you have, the more accurate your reading can be.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I might suggest having sensors at various different heights as well, if you want to count children as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Alternatively, you can make yourself a weight sensitive plate which would be hooked up to a RPi or some kind of computer." />

Text="Only if you put the Dots in separate accounts. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The problem with IFTTT is that you can only connect to the Alexa services once. Vice versa the Alexa App doesn't allow differentiating between several Echo Dots for specific Skills. (Just try it, there are literally no settings on either side to help you out.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To achieve a recipe that's only active on one device you'd have to use two Amazon Accounts. Those can then both be connected to the same IFTTT account. (I haven't tested that. Maybe you need two of those as well.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Problematically if you use two Echo Dots in separate Accounts (that are not somehow connected to form a household) you'll likely trigger both at the same time. As far as I know the [Echo Spatial Perception][1] only works if the Echos are in the same account. So using separate accounts would rob you of that feature and likely have two Echos react. One failing to provide a proper answer because it's not connected to your IFTTT Recipe.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To solve that you could use different wake words on the Echos. (Echo One reacts to &quot;Alexa&quot;, Echo Two in the other account reacts to &quot;Computer&quot;.) That means two Echos, two Amazon accounts, two wake words. You'll have to judge if that IFTTT Recipe of yours is that important to only work on one Echo.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1]:http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/139677-doubling-up-on-alexa-how-to-use-multiple-amazon-echo-and-dots" />

You could potentially replicate that too across different providers, but at this point it starts to get expensive, because you *are* paying multiple times for the storage of your data, and it could easily get out of sync, adding complexity to the service.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Imagine setting your smart thermostat to 20°C on your phone—it might synchronise that data with cloud server #1, which then crashes before the data is pushed to the other storage, so cloud server #2 thinks that you still want your thermostat at 10°C, and you get home to a freezing house.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Essentially, **making reliable IoT services is hard, but criticising poor design is easy**, it seems." />

That's where the real problem is situated. The services that provide load balancing and indexing where the other stuff is. Having redundant computing or storage is easy. It's also not really that expensive. As you point out there are enough models where most of the cost only applies when actually used.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Like on this [Wikipedia load-balancing page][1] the load balancer is mostly pictured as singular instance. Even though that's a vast simplification there is very little cross-provider load-balancing. Thus, if your AWS load balancer shuts down there is no use in having tons of Google Cloud Functions and OneDrive storage available. Your IoT devices won't find their way towards those services. They will be looking at the false domains/IPs for your cloud service.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The rest is set up redundantly anyways. What happened to Amazon is that they inadvertently shut down their single point of failure. That one server with the big red ***never shut it down*** sign. By mistake they took down the [indexing server for the S3 on the east coast][2].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; One of these subsystems, the index subsystem, manages the metadata and location information of all S3 objects in the region. This subsystem is necessary to serve all GET, LIST, PUT, and DELETE requests.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Essentially the service that knows what's where. However you design your infrastructure there will always be similar points. Just take it from Amazon, even the number #1 cloud provider didn't dare to touch that system.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;While this is an operation that we have relied on to maintain our systems since the launch of S3, we have not completely restarted the index subsystem or the placement subsystem in our larger regions for many years.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you read their blog to the end, they have no actual solution to that. They are just trying to reduce the chance it happens again. There will always be critical points where you can't have redundancies—or redundancies that area extremely costly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At the end it likely is cheaper to have the service go down and wait for the big three cloud providers to get it back up.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)&#xD;&#xA;[2]:https://aws.amazon.com/de/message/41926/" />

Some devices will simply fail completely if their connection to a remote cloud server is lost, like the [Amazon Echo](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201549640):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Your Echo requires an active Wi-Fi connection to speak, process your commands, and stream media.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes, there's a good reason (for example, the Echo has to stream commands to the cloud to process your instructions, as stated in 'http://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/357/is-the-amazon-echo-always-listening-and-sending-data-to-the-cloud'), but for others, it may just be an oversight or design flaw in your product.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you physically have the device, you could try unplugging your router to see what happens—this might not be a great test, because it's more likely a remote server will break but local connections will still work, but it's something to try.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With enough time to &lt;s&gt;waste&lt;/s&gt; *use productively to improve your setup*, you could potentially sniff packets from your devices, then apply a router-level block to certain domains—this way, you'd know what happened if `mydeviceserver.com` went down completely. Of course, this would take **a long time** so it might not be practical to test all of your devices in a large home with lots of 'smart' devices.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Use local connectivity&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you're just turning your lights on from your smart switch, you might not need to route all the traffic through the Internet, into a cloud server thousands of miles away, and back to your lightbulb—you might just be able to route the command through local devices instead. A lot of the time, these devices will use a protocol like ZigBee or Z-Wave, so you might need a hub to co-ordinate the traffic (see 'http://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/958/why-do-i-need-hubs-for-some-devices-when-automating-my-home').&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## As a developer&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For developers of IoT devices, careful design of a device can avoid problems like the recent S3 outage from affecting consumers. Of course, IoT designers [aren't always known](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/03/02/chinese_iot_kit_backdoor_claims/) for *careful* design, but if you're reading this, you're probably not in that group.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Design services to be redundant&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For Amazon S3's recent outage in particular, there may not have been much you could do. There are some reports that [cross-region replication](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-cross-region-replication-for-amazon-s3/) could have potentially prevented services from going down, as explained in [this question on DevOps Stack Exchange](http://devops.stackexchange.com/questions/83/what-is-a-good-strategy-to-keep-my-site-online-when-s3-goes-offline), but it's [debated whether that's really true or just poor advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/5xat9a/s3_crossregion_replication_would_it_have_really/). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If feasible, having some sort of redundancy or backup would be ideal—although the costs are greater, the additional reliability is greatly needed—otherwise, people's lights stop responding, power switches refuse to work, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Add better support for scenarios without Internet connections&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I listed 'Use local connectivity' under the ways that a consumer could avoid this issue, **but it's a losing battle**. The devices often don't support connecting in any other way than through their approved web service, and manufacturers are reluctant to spend developer time on this. If the support was greater, there would be less reliance on cloud services, which benefits the manufacturer too, because they don't need to pay for so much server capacity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## With all these options, why were so many devices affected?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Because no-one wants to spend the time*—designing any sort of reliable system takes a lot of time and effort, and it's often far more complex than the comparable 'dumb' solution (e.g. simple electrical switches). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Why isn't software as reliable as a car?](http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/41050/why-isnt-software-as-reliable-as-a-car) Because the software has so much more complexity, yet isn't tested nearly as rigorously as a car would be. The same issue seems to apply with IoT—controlling devices through a network is far more complex, so things can go wrong far more easily, as we've seen with the recent S3 incident." />

Only modules are viable unless you have access to ~$1e6 in test equipment and the skills to use this. As soon as you need to put RF on the PCB, it's hard. Long-range RF is harder.&#xD;&#xA; 2. In order to protect other users, the testing regime is hard (FCC/type-approval).&#xD;&#xA; 3. Companies are still presumably making good money in licensing software stacks for the newer protocols.&#xD;&#xA; 4. Although there is demand for products, it's easier for the SoC designer to spend sales and support costs on a few tier-1 opportunities, rather than many more tier-3 potentials. For small volumes, it's potentially a commodity market which is not appealing (so long as the tipping point can be postponed).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Effectively these are similar answers to why is it hard to purchase some high-end SoC in even medium volumes.

The publicly-available [source code of Mirai](https://github.com/jgamblin/Mirai-Source-Code) seems to suggest that it just sends packets to as many IPs as it can, and if there's a reply, it then randomly tries the default passwords that it knows. [I wrote an answer previously about that](http://iot.stackexchange.com/a/913/12), if you're interested.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My concern would be that if Mirai did manage to enter your home network—through just *one* misconfigured or insecure device—it would render all of your firewalls and security useless. One of Mirai's IP ranges to check is `192.168.0.0/16` (your router's [private network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network)), so Mirai would almost certainly spread through all your vulnerable devices.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The solution to stop Mirai from being able to attack your network is simple—**change every device's password from its default, and restart the device**. If you do that, Mirai can't attack *even if your device is accessible through the Internet* (not to say it's a good idea to *make* things accessible if not necessary, though!).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[There is a list of vulnerable devices here](https://www.scribd.com/document/328743810/Mirai-Devices#fullscreen&amp;from_embed), or you can run [Incapsula's scanner](https://www.incapsula.com/blog/mirai-scanner-unwitting-mirai-botnet-recruit.html). Note that those will only check for vulnerability to Mirai—other viruses may operate differently, and following the suggestions in 'http://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/9/securing-small-home-automation-setup' is probably your best bet." />

I basically needed to push some data(from Arduino) on a webpage(hosted by a local server). I searched and found about **MQTT** protocol which enables to publish and subscribe data on clients(Exactly what I wanted). But most of the tutorials I am finding are either entirely on Arduino(with wifi shield) or entirely on esp8266. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What I want to know is that is there a possible way to use MQTT as with my current configuration? That is, using Arduino to do all the work and by using its serial comm. Publishing data just by AT commands on MQTT. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additional Information about my project is mentioned here : http://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/1130/confused-about-which-technology-to-use-in-smart-home-system" />

IoT Hub devices never act as a 'server', and this is a crucial part of the security model in Azure IoT. The definitive model on this is encapsulated in Clemens Vasters' ['Service Assisted Communication'][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Therefore devices are always 'polling' an external service in order to send data or receive commands. The APIs make it look like data is being sent to a device, but it is always the device making the outgoing connection.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;IoT hub does this in two ways:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. By sending data to the device endpoint ``` /devices/{deviceId}/messages/devicebound ```. This is an AMQP messaging endpoint, similar to a queue or topic subscription. The device, when reading commands, needs to acknowledged receipt if needed, which is part of the underlying AMQP protocol. This works the same with MQTT, and https is a valid fallback.&#xD;&#xA;The API wraps all of this up for you. There are additional concepts, such as 'direct methods' which are an API wrapper around essentially the same underlying message protocol&#xD;&#xA;2. By using the server-side device twin, which is a way to logically keep properties in sync between device and server. You set a property on the device twin, and when the device syncs up that property will be synced to the device. This is less message-based and built on top of the LWM2M device management protocol.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A lot of the 'polling', connecting, sharing connections, receipts, etc should be taken care of as part of the AMQP (or MQTT) protocol, which in turn is wrapped up in the IoT Hub SDK. So the above is highly simplified, but to reiterate, IoT Hub cannot, and will not (ever) try and send data to a ip address/port on your device.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/clemensv/2014/02/09/service-assisted-communication-for-connected-devices/" />

Amazon have [a little bit of guidance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/x509-certs.html) about how you should secure your certificates, so I'll quote that here:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Certificates enable asymmetric keys to be used with devices. This means you can burn private keys into secure storage on a device without ever allowing the sensitive cryptographic material to leave the device.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since you're currently using the STM32's [Read Out Protection](http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/application_note/b4/14/62/81/18/57/48/05/DM00075930.pdf/files/DM00075930.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.DM00075930.pdf) (RDP), all but the most determined attackers will have trouble accessing your certificates in your current scheme:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The global Read Out Protection allows the embedded firmware code (preloaded in the Flash memory) to protect against reverse engineering, dumping using debug tools or other means of intrusive attack.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Level 0 - No protection (default)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Level 1 - Flash memory is protected against reading by debugging or code dumping&#xD;&#xA;by the RAM loaded code&#xD;&#xA;&gt; - Level 2 - All debug features are disabled&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Is external storage going to be secure?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**It probably isn't *as* secure**. If your client's private key is stolen, an attacker can send data that appears to be from your device, when it actually isn't. Although it's not clear what data you're sending, any untrusted data can be a security risk.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Which bits do I need to keep private?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you create a device certificate on AWS IoT, you should see an image like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![AWS IoT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/images/certificate-created.png)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/images/certificate-created.png)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;Image from the [*Create and Activate a Device Certificate*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/create-device-certificate.html) page of the AWS IoT documentation.&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The private key is the thing you really need to keep... *private*, and should definitely be stored on the read-protected memory if possible. The public key and certificate are designed to be shared, so if you're running out of space, you can safely move those to external storage. You can get a little bit more context on the page [*How does SSL/TLS work?*](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/20803/how-does-ssl-tls-work) at Information Security Stack Exchange and [*Public-key cryptography*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) on Wikipedia. I think I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't include this image to explain *why* the private key needs to be secret:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Public key cryptography](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Public_key_encryption.svg/525px-Public_key_encryption.svg.png)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Public_key_encryption.svg/525px-Public_key_encryption.svg.png).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;Image from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography#/media/File:Public_key_encryption.svg), released into the public domain.&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your device's **public key** is what AWS IoT uses to sign messages to send to your device (but it **does not prove who is sending the message**). So, really, it's not a huge disaster if someone steals the public key, because it's not meant to be a secret.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The **private key** is what your device uses to decrypt messages, so it's a slightly bigger problem if an attacker steals this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You also asked what would happen if the attacker stole the RootCA certificate. If someone stole **AWS IoT's private key**, it would be disastrous, but the RootCA certificate on your device **isn't that**. The `RootCA.crt` that Amazon give you is [completely public](https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/verisign/roots/VeriSign-Class%203-Public-Primary-Certification-Authority-G5.pem), and the purpose is so that you can verify that you're not being attacked in any way (most likely a man-in-the-middle pretending to be AWS IoT's servers).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## What damage could a hacked device do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your stolen device can only perform the actions listed [in the policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/attach-iot-policy.html). Try to follow the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege); only grant your device the privileges it **absolutely needs**, so if the worst does happen, it can't wreak havoc too much. For your specific case:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The thing is allowed to publish to only 2 channels (its name and a data feed channel) which is connected to a data processor which will ignore any rogue packets coming to it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's good. Any attack should be isolated to just the two MQTT topics that the device can publish to, so it won't cause large scale harm." />

The intent schema defines which actions can be performed, and the [*slots*](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/built-in-intent-ref/slot-type-reference) for custom data to be sent to your API. The sample utterances provide examples of how a user can trigger each intent.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- When the user activates your Skill, Alexa will try to match what they said to one of your skill's sample utterances. If it **does** match, it will send an HTTPS request to your server to ask for a response.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Your server provides a response (if all goes well) and then Alexa will give feedback to the user who triggered your skill.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The [`AMAZON.LITERAL` slot](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/alexa-skills-kit-interaction-model-reference#literal-slot-type-reference) allows you to accept virtually any input. Note that currently it is only supported in the English (US) region—English (UK) and German skills cannot use `AMAZON.LITERAL`.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your intent schema might look like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    {&#xD;&#xA;      &quot;intents&quot;: [&#xD;&#xA;        {&#xD;&#xA;          &quot;intent&quot;: &quot;SaveTodo&quot;,&#xD;&#xA;          &quot;slots&quot;: [&#xD;&#xA;            {&#xD;&#xA;              &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Todo&quot;,&#xD;&#xA;              &quot;type&quot;: &quot;AMAZON.LITERAL&quot;&#xD;&#xA;            }&#xD;&#xA;          ]&#xD;&#xA;        }&#xD;&#xA;      ]&#xD;&#xA;    }&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And your sample utterances might be like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    SaveTodo remind me to {fetch the shopping|Todo}&#xD;&#xA;    SaveTodo remind me to {write my English essay|Todo}&#xD;&#xA;    SaveTodo remind me to {buy some dog food tomorrow|Todo}&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When using `AMAZON.LITERAL`, you need to provide *lots* of sample utterances—at least one sample for each possible length of input, but ideally more. The Amazon documentation suggests that you should be aiming for hundreds of samples for slots where you could accept various types of inputs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It does seem a little tedious, but if you don't do this, it's unlikely that your skill will recognise text well. You could perhaps generate sample utterances from customer data (so long as personal information is removed beforehand!) so that the most common utterances are in your samples—I suspect Alexa will be slightly biased towards recognising utterances similar to the samples.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Amazon [discourage `AMAZON.LITERAL` slots though, and would prefer you to use custom slot types](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/migrating-to-the-improved-built-in-and-custom-slot-types#literal), which require you to list the possible inputs. It's important to remember that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A custom slot type is not the equivalent of an enumeration. Values outside the list may still be returned if recognized by the spoken language understanding system. Although input to a custom slot type is weighted towards the values in the list, it is not constrained to just the items on the list. Your code still needs to include validation and error checking when using slot values.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

If you don't actually need to do that, you might not need a hub at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A ZigBee network (whether it's a mesh, star or tree) [requires a coordinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZigBee#Overview) device. There's a brief overview [here](http://community.silabs.com/t5/Mesh-Knowledge-Base/What-is-the-difference-between-an-end-device-a-router-and-a/ta-p/113449), but one device needs to be responsible for forming and administering the network, so a hub is a straightforward option to fill that gap.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can see in [this diagram](https://community.smartthings.com/t/faq-mapping-your-zigbee-network-with-digis-xctu/28477) that the SmartThings hub acts as a coordinator for the home network—that's where the hub is useful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you were confident that the device would be able to handle the demands, you could just make *ZigBee A* the coordinator and run a mesh network between your devices—they'd be able to communicate fine without a hub, so long as you didn't want to connect them to the Internet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you were just connecting a switch to a lightbulb, you could do it without a hub. However, at that point, ask yourself: *is this really better than just connecting the bulb to a switch with a wire?* The whole point of automating your home is so that you can control things remotely from other devices (or a hub to schedule things automatically). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

The high level topology is equally suitable for a farm monitoring application covering several kilometres with thousands or sensors, tracking parking spaces in a city, or lighting management in an office building.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'll treat the problem approximately in layers of device hierarchy, which might correspond to increasing complexity of an installation, or pulling in specific use case scenarios. Here is my generalised diagram covering the whole network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![enter image description here][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Node level**&#xD;&#xA;The individual node in my diagram is a WiFi connected lamp with a local physical override switch. The node often has both sensor and control functions, and a small amount of local compute/storage. Ideally, the node can act autonomously. The node can take control from local switches, directly over the LAN (if it has WiFi/Bluetooth), or from either the local hub or the cloud. A node will frequently maintain a persistent TCP connection with the hub or cloud.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One location typically contains several nodes, with different functions, using various connectivity options. A smart-home might collect indoor/outdoor temperature, activity and video data. Remote sensors may use disparate connections to the internet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Hub Level** In a smart home, there might be several hubs (one for each device vendor), aggregation or hierarchy. The hub can be combined in the router, or stand-alone. The hub doesn't even need to be active in the network (other than to forward packets). However, the hub might be responsible for relaying commands to a node - commands originating from either other locally connected nodes or from a remote server. The hub might implement store-forward of data, compression or filtering of data. Really, the hub is just a facilitator. Today, the hub is the first part of the network that has the ability to provide public DNS, which makes it able to publish network structure information to the full system. As described in [this question][2] a hub is often necessary to bridge between Wired/WiFi TCP-IP to a low-power radio protocol, such as ZigBee or BT-LE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Roaming Terminals** Otherwise known as your smartphone. These are often the primary point of user interaction. A simple node can present it's entire user-interface through a smartphone, once the node can establish either a direct or a mediated link with a specific device. Achieving this fundamentally requires a mechanism for establishing trust/ownership/pairing. A terminal can establish if it's own hub is on the local network, if it needs to perform _all_ communication via an external server, or if it is able to lookup the IP address which allows direct routing to it's 'home' hub. The latter scenario usually requires that the router is configured for port forwarding.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Cloud service** It is common for the cloud service to perform the majority of the work in the stack, although this is not always necessary (and not all implementations will require any cloud function). The most useful feature that an external (publicly addressed) server can provide is orchestration. Every node and intermediate element of the network is usually able to communicate over a direct channel to this server, and the server can easily pass messages from one device to the others. The server can aggregate data and present visualisations to the user. Based on the user's configuration, it can also forward information to other users (access and heating control can be granted to guests for example, flood/fire/intrusion warnings could use other network options to generate alerts). The cloud is also well placed to take in other data sources, so modifying heating profiles based on forecast and calendar information, or feeding local sensor information into local forecasting models, generating alerts for utility providers and so on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/YMRCQ.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/958/why-do-i-need-hubs-for-some-devices-when-automating-my-home" />

This is hugely important in an evolving ecosystem where you anticipate a service evolving over several years of development.&#xA;&#xA;Although a tightly coded binary data structure will be efficient to transmit, you need to decide up-front at a minimum what the structure will look like. When, later you realise that even one field needs expansion, you're stuck. Even rolling out an update to the protocol is hard, since you can't obsolete an old encoding till every endpoint is updated.&#xA;&#xA;This suggests that the optimum approach is to mix minimalist packets and markup based encoding (using the latter as a fallback). The value of this depends on the highest bandwidth payloads. If you're already transferring frequent video sized chunks, optimising the infrequent control data is less worthwhile. If you have frequent small transfers (a temperature maybe), it makes sense to minimise the overhead in transmission -but maybe just batching the transfers is as good." />

If alarm: I want an option to snooze not so easily (with I Can't Wake Up, I can make it so that I have to slide up to snooze or slide down to dismiss).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But it's a hassle to get my phone out every time wherein sometimes I have to first unlock the phone first snoozing the alarm (I Can't Wake Up has 'Quit Block', but I have yet to try this).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm hoping some smartwatch has the ability to go off at 12:05pm or 5 minutes after I set the timer (which would be around 12pm) so that I just have to swipe my watch instead of taking out my phone.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I haven't been able to find such features for any smartwatch, but I may be using wrong keywords.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/questions/30949/countdown-timer-or-pomodoro-for-android-that-is-automatically-restarted-but-asks/39551#39551&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/questions/31167/hiit-timer-variant-for-android&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kog.alarmclock&amp;hl=en" />

We often incorrectly use the term protocol when we mean the format of the data. I do this myself, often because the distinction isn't clear to everyone.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Messaging protocols used in IoT tend to be fairly compact, at least more so than http and offer significant features that are important in messaging (sessions, flow control, reliability, etc). The message format is the &lt;bytes&gt; of data in the message that get sent. I assume that this is what you are asking about.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most compact message format is a carefully considered hand-rolled binary format. It is frequently used when in low-bandwidth scenarios when you want to send a few bytes, and know exactly what those bytes look like. For larger messages the disadvantages are significant and, in general, should be avoided at all costs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I went through a detailed assessment on many different data serialisation options. I expected protobuf, messagepack to be fairly compact, which they were. However, my second problem was finding libraries that were maintained and available on a number of different platforms, including C on the device.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The format that I settled on, surprisingly, was gzip compressed JSON. It is easy to implement and understand, runs everywhere, and, with the data that I was using, was about the same, or smaller, than other methods.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also beware that if you have a secure channel such as TLS, you're going to consume a chunk of data (&gt;6KB) in TLS handshakes anyway.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A few years ago, I expected a format like protocol buffers to dominate, but not much really happened. Probably because of the ease at which json can be written out and parsed (and compressed). I like the look of [Flatbuffers][1], but the advantage is more on parsing speed than being compact.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since you are at the investigation stage, I suggest you write a bit of code on each, using data that is typical to you situation, and do some comparisons.

You might just be able to use a USB camera ([according to this discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/android-rpi/7jR_ER1pCbA)) although there's no definitive documentation as to which devices work and which don't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are [some reports](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/android-rpi/microphone%7Csort:relevance/android-rpi/glkEAeqG6Xs/JLoAfPg6BQAJ) that microphones don't work all that well, and sound is known to be a problem, but it may have been fixed in the more recent versions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you're more interested in making the Raspberry Pi run iOS, [you're out of luck](http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/1289/ios-on-a-raspberry-pi)—Apple are not at all keen for people to run their software on non-Apple devices.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />
