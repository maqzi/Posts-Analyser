8,8,,,"<p>As always, a big part of security with ""connect from anywhere"" setups is ensuring the security of your account information. The usual rules apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't share your password</li>
<li>Avoid using cookies to save passwords (although cookies are always hard to resist)</li>
<li>Regularly change passwords</li>
<li>Be aware of other breaches via email (phishing, scams, etc.) including breaches in credible company systems. For instance, if Target's customer database is breached, please change your passwords.</li>
<li>Use unique passwords (thanks @Gilles)</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Don't use WEP!</strong>, instead use WPA2(PSK) or better on your network and keep up-to-date with which protocols are the strongest.</li>
<li>Keep your router/modem updated. I believe that most routers (especially older models) do not self-update and many people forget to check/install the latest firmware updates to their router.</li>
<li>Create a separate Wi-Fi network for your IoT devices. Alternatively, setup a subnet in your network to connect your IoT devices.</li>
<li>Install/setup a firewall on your router.</li>
<li>Disable any guest network or elevate the security protocol.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, security is mostly out of your control from a consumer level with apps, websites, and technically your raw data. All data transactions through virtually any type of network is susceptible to improper or unintended use.</p>

<p>Well, technically, there is no such thing as absolute security. Doing so should be technically safe enough, if we consider that your router doesn't have any vulnerabilities and can separate the network well enough. <strong>Enable</strong> ""Client Isolation"" (or whatever your router company calls it) if your router supports it (It may be under NAS, Firewall or Wireless menus): </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are IoT devices a major security risk to have on the same network as my PC?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kinda. While I haven't read of such an attack yet, IoT devices can technically be used to sniff the Internet communications or to make use of vulnerabilities on your operating system or the software you have installed to take it over. This can be a bigger risk if your PC has SSH or Telnet port open, and especially if it uses an insecure password. This was actually abused by the Mirai botnet: It attacked telnet ports of devices and tested common passwords to try to take over the device, to include it in the botnet. But this requires a vulnerability in both the IoT device and your computer, so it's unlikely to happen.</p>

57,57,326.0,5.0,"<p>Basically when it comes to IoT, the two main communication methods which come to my mind are either Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. I know that there are others as well like ZigBee, Z-Wave but I would like to stay at either Wi-Fi or Bluetooth as they are supported by smart phones and tablets by default.</p>

<p><strong>Application overview</strong>, system specifications:</p>

<ul>
<li>No HD cameras in any device.</li>
<li>Purpose is to have connected all the locks, both windows and entrance doors and even dog doors.</li>
<li>All light switches should be connected with feedback information about the current state of the particular lamp. (Switches can be controlled remotely and manually as well.)</li>
<li>Be able to handle proximity sensors several ones per room.</li>
<li>I want the system to be able to handle smart air conditioners (these should be controlled remotely and be able to give feedback about temperature and humidity values.)</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, I have a lot of devices with low bandwidth requirements and the main goal is to have a system that is as scalable as possible. So if I move to a twice as big house which needs almost twice as much sensors, I want it to be the easiest to install the additional ones.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now I know the basic advantages and disadvantages of the two compared. It is listed at this site <a href=""http://www.diffen.com/difference/Bluetooth_vs_Wifi"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bluetooth vs. Wi-Fi</a> (the image is taken from here as well).</p>

<p>To highlight: Some Bluetooth is cheap and easier to use. However, Wi-Fi is more secure, has a higher range and bandwidth but, of course, costs more.</p>

<hr>

<p>So the question is: At the dawn of a project, how can one decide which one will be the more suitable for the task? I consider the scalability as the most important spec.</p>

62,62,,,"<p>That question is too broad, but given that you omitted the single most important thing, I feel I need to pipe up.</p>

<p><strong>Authenticate the update</strong>.</p>

<p>If you want to make sure that your devices are running your code, then you need authentication, not encryption. Encryption is the property that other people can't know what's in your code, and that's hard to achieve and rarely useful. Authenticity is the property that other people can't produce a fake update, and that property is usually desirable.</p>

<p>Note that encrypting does not help with authenticity. This is a false belief that people who don't really understand security sometimes have, but it's just not true.</p>

<p>For some devices, it's fine to run any firmware if the owner so chooses. In that case, you still need some mechanism to ensure that only the owner of the device can install firmware, and not some random passer-by. Generally that means that the device must authenticate the update as coming from the registered owner.</p>

  <p>What is the preferred way to disconnect them from power? What if there is a power cut?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I assume you are talking about devices which act as gateways to aggregate and send it to the cloud (for e.g.: Raspberry Pi runs on Debian which is full blown OS) and generally runs from power source which is other than a cell battery. Taking RPi as an example, you can directly take out power just like laptop there will be no data loss as the data will be stored in drives, chances of corruption here are minimal or rare.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Will I lose the data? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It depends on how data is stored or read from devices. Most of the sensors (maybe fridges or cameras) don't store any data if even if they store data storage will be limited to the amount that chip can offer. Gateways or aggregators ask sensors for data continuously/periodically to send data which then will be stored in the gateway which is not limited device in comparison to sensors (e.g.: RPi).</p>

<p>The section which I assume applies to your device is <strong>2.3.5.9</strong>, which states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) each installed or spare battery must not exceed:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>for lithium metal or lithium alloy batteries, a lithium content of not more than 2 g; or</p></li>
  <li><p>for lithium ion batteries, a watt-hour rating of not more than 100 Wh.</p></li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>(b) batteries and cells must be of a type that meets the requirements of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, Part III, subsection 38.3;</p>
  
  <p>(c) articles containing lithium metal or lithium ion cells or batteries, the primary purpose of which is to provide power to another device, are permitted in carry-on baggage only. These articles must be individually protected to prevent short circuits by placement in the original retail packaging or by otherwise insulating terminals, e.g. by taping over exposed terminals or placing each battery in a separate plastic bag or protective pouch.</p>
  
  <p>(d) if devices are carried in checked baggage the passenger/crew member must take measures to prevent unintentional activation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your battery has approximately 7.4 Wh of energy (2000 mAh * (3.7 V / 1000)), which is very low and unlikely to be considered a powerful battery, and is <strong>well below</strong> the given limit.</p>

<p>However, the best advice would be to consult with your airline to ensure that they do not have more strict rules than this (and don't wait until you get to the gate - ask <strong>well in advance</strong> because it's likely that most staff will not know the exact rules).</p>

<p>As for the GSM chip,  you will need to <strong>fully</strong> disable any hardware capable of electromagnetic interference (which would include this chip). If it will be stored somewhere that you cannot access throughout the flight, the best course of action would be to remove any sources of power completely (i.e. the battery).</p>

90,90,,,"<p>To ensure that your device is secure enough, I have several tips:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add some encryption to the Bluetooth communication. I'd recommend keeping the encryption keys off air. For example, you might ask the user to scan a QR code that's on the device, on printed in the box etc. at the initial setup of mobile app, maybe with an AES key? Up to you. This is to prevent someone from seeing the password transmitted over the air with plain text.</li>
<li>If you can, stay away from ECB (use CBC) mode of the encryption algorithm you pick, as it might give some info on the data transmitted. <a href=""http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/20941/why-shouldnt-i-use-ecb-encryption"">More info on that can be found here</a>.</li>
<li>On the bluetooth data transmission, make sure to include some unique ID, so that the message can't be repeated (for example, you might include a timestamp). You might also implement some TOTP-like system.</li>
<li>Put a port on the device that allows it to be easily flashed, so that in case you realize the software has a bug (and for some reason you can't update it OTA), the device is not an expensive paperweight, just a device that needs to be plugged into a PC and flashed to new software.</li>
<li>Extra: To ensure that someone with a rogue root cert (probably self-issued and installed on client device) can't intercept your server communications, verify the HTTPS certificate. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5700477/receive-validate-certificate-from-server-https-android"">Here is a SO asking it for Android, you must be able to find similar resources for iOS too</a>.</li>

91,91,,,"<p>In answer to the first question - yes, it is possible in a pragmatic sense, and running a separate network will not appreciably impede functionality, assuming the separate network is given sufficient access to the Internet to allow basic connectivity from the device(s) in question to its / their respective ""home base"" services.</p>

<p>In answer to the second question - while it is advantageous from a security perspective, I would not deem it to be ""significantly"" advantageous. Many of the current exploits around IoT devices involve vulnerabilities on the service side, not necessarily on the device itself. Separating the networks between ""regular computing"" and ""IoT"" in your home will help mitigate risks to your home computing infrastructure, but will not reduce risks to the devices themselves, or to the Internet in general from devices that have been taken over via vulnerabilities in the services they connect to.</p>

<li>software version</li>
<li>timestamp of call/request</li>
<li>product type / id</li>

I can run DB queries that tell me which customers are on older versions, and/or which customers have not called in for a while.</p>

<p>Those covered ISDN &amp; ISUP, then, later GSM, and GPRS.</p>

<p>Analog(ue) technology was considered to be first generation, and digital (ISN &amp; ISUP) to be second (ISDN was between subscriber and exchange, and ISUP was between exchanges)).</p>

<p>ISCN was still <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_switching"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">circuit switched</a>, and GPRS, which was <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">packet switched</a>, became known as 2.5 generation, since it used the same <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_stratum"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Access Stratum</a> as ISDN.</p>

120,120,,,"<p>As a software guy—and a protocol stack guy at that—I tend to look differently at this than you might.</p>

<p>To me, these protocols are ""low level"" stuff (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">layer 1 &amp; 2 of the OSI 7 layer model</a>).</p>

<p>I don't particularly care about power consumption, unless the device is battery or solar powered. In my professional life, I can leave decisions about hardware, which , if it is off-the-shelf, tends to dictate the choice of the Layer 2 protocol, to the hardware guys. In my private life, I choose by price, support (size of community &amp; availability of forums is <strong>very</strong> important) and a best guess understanding of the spec</p>

<p>I tend to look for the functionality of the overall system. For instance, for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mesh networks</a>, there are some excellent ZigBee solutions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, do some signals work better long-range and some better in
  ""noisy"" environments?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For long-range, I cannot recommend highly enough <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flutterwireless/flutter-20-wireless-arduino-with-half-mile-1km-ran"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Flutter</a> with a 1km/half mile range, as opposed to 100m.</p>

<p>It costs only US $20, and here is a picture to give you some idea of the range 
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bq3gC.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bq3gC.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Noisy environments is not my speciality—I leave that to the hardware guys, sorry—but you might want to look into things like the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy-channel_coding_theorem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Shannon limit</a>, which is a software, as opposed to hardware, approach to noise (also, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_error_correction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Forward Error Correction</a>, etc)</p>

<p>As I said, those protocols are ""low level"" stuff to me, as an application developer (layer 3 guy, actually, which is a little lower).</p>

<p>Yes, it is important that you consider that sort of thing, but many will just say ""I know, I will go with Raspberry PI (or whatever)"" and accept whatever it offers.</p>

<p>After that, when developing your application, you need to decide which higher level protocol to use. Generally, unless your server dictates a particular protocol, you have three main choices:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use TCP, and develop a proprietary protocol.</li>
<li>Use HTTP(S) and develop a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RESTful</a> interface (go <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AJAX</a> if you want asynchronous, non-blocking, for instance if you multi-thread). Unless you have many transactions, are time critical, or your server operations will take a long time, you can get away with a blocking interface. </li>
<li>Choose one of the plethora of IoT ""standards"". I would only advise this if your device provides strong support for one particular protocol, or your server demands it.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have developed tracking systems, and can tell you the following - for package tracking, you do <strong><em>not</em></strong> get the current location. </p>

<p>You package is tracked at ""gateways"" along its delivery route. It is collected or handed over to the shipper, then it goes to a depot, from there, possibly, to an airport or ship, reaches a destination (air)port, gets loaded onto another truck, goes to another depot, onto a another truck, and heads towards you ... </p>

<p>... but, at every step along the way, it is scanned &amp; updates the database which provide you with tracking info. You are <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> (currently, this year, or any time soon), going to see ""it is on the high street; it just passed the crossroads; it is turning into your street; your drive way"".</p>

<p>In short, packages are not GPS tracked, just checked off at waypoints,</p>

<hr>

<p>I have also tracked trucks and shipping containers (outdoor stuff). </p>

<p>Where a 'phone network is available, we periodically get a GPS fix &amp; send it by SMS (which is generally cheaper than using TCP (although Singapore is a special case, with almost complete free wifi coverage)).</p>

<p>Out of network range, we use cheap (US $500) low data rate satellite modems, such as those from <a href=""http://www.orbcomm.com/en/hardware"">SkyWave</a>.</p>

<p>Note that we pros tend to prefer  GPS for accuracy, but you can also use Google Maps, which will traingulate on cell towers, with less accuracy.</p>

<p>Some of the IOT cloud service vendors keep referring to installing an embedded agent on the sensor based edge devices. It appears to be a proprietary piece of software which vendors install on each device connecting to the cloud. Below are two images of software stacks with references to <strong>Agent</strong>. A portion of the of software stack reside in the microcontroller.  </p>

<p>Also here is very broad explanation Thingworx blog</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An agent is an embedded program that runs on or near an IoT device and
  reports the status of some asset or environment. There is always some
  agent present in an IoT application. Typically the agent reads the
  status from sensors or local connectivity to an asset, applies some
  rules or logic about how often the sender has to aggregate the
  information, and then sends the information over a long-haul
  communications network to the server. This process can operate in
  reverse as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is my assumption this agent consist of connectivity information such as IP address, server name, SSID type information to aid connectivity. Does these Embedded Agents have other functionality beyond providing connectivity? </p>

132,132,,,"<p>The absolute most common issue with IoT devices is default passwords. So <strong>change all the passwords</strong>. Pick a unique, random password for every device and write it down on paper (paper is safe from remote attackers and hard drive failures). 12 <em>random</em> (i.e. computer-generated) lowercase letters represent a good compromise between security and being hard to type. Each device should have a different password so that breaking one doesn't let the attacker break all of them. Enter the passwords in a password manager and use that password manager in the computers you use to control the devices.</p>

<p>If the device has different authorization channels, for example an administration password and a day-to-day usage password, use different passwords for both and only record the administration password on selected devices.</p>

<p>The second generic security measure is to ensure that all your devices are behind a firewall or at least a NAT device. A typical home router is sufficient, but you should turn off UPnP which can allow inadvertent back channels from the outside. The goal is to ensures that there's no direct way to connect from the Internet to the device.

133,133,,,"<p>If you can have end-to-end TCP, then use <strong>end-to-end TLS</strong> (e.g. with HTTPS).</p>

<p>Don't reinvent the wheel, especially when it comes to cryptography — most people get it wrong. Unless the device is too resource-constrained to support TLS, if you get down to the level of AES, <a href=""https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blog/2009/july/if-youre-typing-the-letters-a-e-s-into-your-code-youre-doing-it-wrong/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">you're doing it wrong</a>. #1 mistake is to encrypt and forget to authenticate — if you have an encrypted channel between your server and a man-in-the-middle, instead of an encrypted channel between your server and your device, then encryption hasn't provided any benefit. If you can't use TLS, make sure that whatever protocol you're using <strong>authenticates everything</strong>, and encrypts what needs to be confidential.</p>

<p>To use TLS securely, think about what guarantees you need to have, from the point of view of each participant. Generally the device needs to know that it's talking to the legitimate server. That means that it must check the server's certificate. The device must have the X.509 certificate of a certificate authority recorded as trusted; this requires storage that can't be modified by an attacker, but it doesn't require any confidentiality of the storage. Note that you shouldn't hard-code the server's certificate directly, because that wouldn't let you easily replace that certificate if it's compromised. Instead, the device stores the expected <em>identity</em> (host name) of the server, and the certificate of a certificate authority that guarantees that a certain public key belongs to the expected host name. Once again, don't reinvent the wheel, rely on the certificate checking provided by your TLS library or application.</p>

<p>If the server needs to know that it's talking to a legitimate client, then each client needs to have its own client certificate. That requires confidential storage on the client. Pass the client certificate to the TLS session opening function from your TLS library, or set it in the application configuration.</p>

<p>That takes care of securing the communication between your server and your device. If the mobile application can talk to the device directly (e.g. to allow disconnected operation while it's on the local wifi network), you need to first perform pairing between the smart switch and the mobile phone. Pairing means an exchange of keys, preferably an exchange of public keys if resources permit, otherwise an agreement of secret keys. The goal of this pairing is to ensure that each device knows who it's talking to.</p>

<p>You'll need to secure the control channel as well, whether it goes directly from the mobile device to the smart switch or via a server. Think about authorization: are there different levels of access to the switch, e.g. a control level that allows doing reconfiguration and a basic channel that just allows on/off switching? This is generally handled by an authentication step after establishing the secure channel (TLS if possible).</p>

<p>Another consideration is firmware updates. That's a tricky one: on the one hand, there's no such thing as absolute security, so you will have security patches to apply now and then. On the other hand, a firmware upgrade mechanism is a complex thing and might itself have bugs. At the very least, make sure that your firmware upgrades are signed. Relying purely on the security of the communication channel for upgrades is dodgy, because the trusted based for a secure channel is larger than for a static security verification, and sometimes you might want to apply firmware updates without a network connection. In addition to verifying the signature, ideally you should have some protection against rollback, so that an adversary can't just push an “update” to version 1 on a system running version 2 and then exploit the security hole that version 2 patched.</p>

134,134,,,"<p>Generally speaking, an agent is a 'bi-directional' piece of software; i.e., it reads parameters <em>from</em> the device and the communicates the same <em>to</em> cloud or even a gateway. More often than not, an OEM will control the libraries for development of the software to control the parameters of the device. Whereas, the OEM may choose any of the popular communication protocols (MQTT, HTTP, etc.) to publish the values read. Typically, integration of these two is the space where a System Integrator comes in.</p>

<p>For example, an agent could be running on a Windows desktop to read the rpm of the fan every 5 seconds. This value is then communicated over to a cloud platform over an agreed protocol.</p>

<p>Sample code from Paho MQTT (Python) <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/paho-mqtt/1.2#network-loop"">web site</a>:</p>

mqttc.loop_start()

while True:
    temperature = sensor.blocking_read()
    mqttc.publish(""paho/temperature"", temperature)
</code></pre>

<p>The above snippet is roughly an agent because there is the 'from device' part in the form of the function <code>sensor.blocking_read()</code> and the 'to cloud' part in the form of a <code>mqttc.publish()</code>.</p>

<p>Advanced agents will have mechanisms to handle offline storage, TLS support for communication towards cloud, respond to any updates from cloud (including reboots, if needed) gracefully, etc. And, in the specific case of this question, the agent will handle power constraints too.

136,136,,,"<p>Wireless and Bluetooth are very close technologies. But, when to choose between one of them you have to consider many things.</p>

<p><strong>Speed:</strong></p>

<p><em>Bluetooth 4.0</em> offers <em>25 Mbps</em> while <em>WiFi Direct</em> can offer you <em>250 Mbps</em>. So if you want a faster transfer rate, i.e. if you need to transfer large amount of data within a short time, and it is your main concern, go for WiFi.</p>

<p><strong>Range:</strong></p>

<p><em>Bluetooth 4.0</em> has three different types, where the range is mostly device dependent. But we can expect 100 ft to 200 ft range from it. <em>WiFi Direct</em> has a range of around 600 ft, which can be vary on the real world scenarios, but seemingly, wifi can transfer data to longer distances.</p>

<p><strong>Security:</strong></p>

<p><em>WiFi Direct</em> is using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WPA2</a> with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AES</a> 256-bit encryption, while <em>bluetooth 4.0</em> uses AES 128-bit encryption. But both of these security measures can provide enough security for most of our tasks. Why bother?</p>

<p><strong>Power Consumption:</strong></p>

<p><em>Bluetooth 4.0</em> has a separate mode called <em>Bluetooth Low Energy (LE)</em> where power consumption is very low. <em>WiFi Direct</em> in the other hand has also been said it have low power consumption, but in this case <em>Bluetooth</em> is probably the winner.</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong></p>

<p>When we build IoT devices, we also have to consider the cost. <em>Bluetooth</em> is clearly low costing technology, where <em>WiFi</em> is still somewhat expensive. This should also be concerned when you select the technology.</p>

<p>So, you can select any of these technologies according to your need.</p>

  <p>Does this mean that if a Client subscribes, then it remains connected to the server while the subscription is valid even though there are no data flow in most of the time?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, once the connection is made the client will wait for messages, however it will also send PING messages to the server regularly based upon the keepalive value. If a PING message is not received by the server then it may disconnect you.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if the Client disconnects after subscription, then a server cannot forward messages to it because it is the Client that should establish conenction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the client is disconnected then yes, it will not receive messages, however there are features in MQTT that work around this.</p>

<p>If the client connects to the server with the 'Clean session' flag set to false, then the server will remember the subscription for that client ID. Once the client reconnects, it will not need to re-subscribe as the server will have remembered it.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you can subscribe using QoS Level 1 or 2. With these QoS Levels, the Server will store messages and wait for the client to reconnect before sending them on. This way, even if the client disconnects and reconnects they will still receive all published messages.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>A DMZ is your friend</strong> - In almost every case where you have a service facing an external network a DMZ (see a.) will be very beneficial. In this case it will both minimize the attack surface and minimize the damage. By limiting the number of devices in the DMZ to only the ones that need external access you limit the attack surface. Also the DMZ will make it much harder for anyone to access your core network, thus minimizing the damage.</li>
<li><strong>Whitelist, don't Blacklist</strong> - By default every single protocol, port and internal connection should be blocked by default. This blocking should be setup in the device (if possible), the firewall and the router. Only enable options that you are actively using and only for the devices that need one. If you know and must use a protocol for an IoT device that is weak (for example devices that are affected by Mirai) you should setup a device (like a RaspberryPi) to act as relay. You completely isolate the device from the network and only communicate with it via a secure protocol (ssh, vpn etc.) that the RaspberryPi transforms into the protocol that the device needs.</li>

169,169,309.0,2.0,"<p>My wife and I just purchased a new house and the ADT Security sensors were still installed, but no keypad panel. After speaking with a Rep on pricing and logistics, we decided not to continue the service.

192,192,,,"<p>There are two main approaches to characterising an antenna and its effectiveness in-system, <code>free space</code> and <code>in-situ</code>. The first will give you a best-case baseline, is less susceptible to measurement noise (especially if you have access to a large anechoic chamber), and probably works best for selecting between candidate antenna variations. <code>In-situ</code> measurements are much less definitive, but allow you to be specific about a possible working scenario, and rule out silly mistakes (like forgetting that the final device has a conductive casework).</p>

<p>Both approaches require a transmit-receive pair. Either one or both can be real devices, propagation is commutative. Take care to use representative power supplies and autonomous operation on real test device. If you connect power or serial cables, these become part of the antenna system.</p>

<p>A good alternative to a spectrum analyser is a Software Defined Radio. Certain USB-DVBTV dongles can be used at very low cost. You shouldn't be as concerned about signal fidelity in this scenario, simple signal strength should be enough. </p>

<p>Ideally you will be close enough in that uncorrected error rate is not a useful metric. Independently, you should understand how signal strength, uncorrected error rate and system performance are related to work out what operating point you are aiming for.</p>

<p>For free space measurements, ideally you will be in an open field, free of power lines and reflective structures for many 10s of metres. Place the DUT on a wooden stand, and observe it from a distance of 5-10 metres (several wavelengths at least). Rotate it in all directions, and measure. Repeat with a comparative device, repeat with any other variations you care about. A directional antenna at the frequency of interest is normally used at one end of the test range, this removes some variation due to the test location (and your presence near this end)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These devices-turned-botnet will still function correctly for the unsuspecting owner, apart from the occasional sluggish bandwidth, and their botnet behavior may go unnoticed indefinitely.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.webroot.com/blog/2016/10/10/source-code-mirai-iot-malware-released/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Webroot.com: Source Code for Mirai IoT Malware Released</a></p>

<p>This tells us how the device changes its behavior. <em>Occasional sluggish bandwidth</em> is unfortunately a really bad indicator to be on the lookout for. The other thing Mirai does is to block ports to avoid monitoring tools to detect it. </p>

<p>These two features can be looked for. The first needs a very sophisticated network traffic monitoring solution and intricate knowledge about what kind of traffic you expect in your network. If your IoT device does not communicate via a WiFi connection but over 3G or other mobile telecommunication standards you are pretty much out of luck because you cannot monitor those. At least not easily and in most jurisdictions not legally.</p>

<p>The second Mirai feature is the thing Incapsula also scans for. If the ports are closed there is a <em>possible</em> Mirai infection. Since rebooting temporarily frees the device from Mirai's clutches the change in port availability in the time after a reboot can be taken as a very likely sign that the device has been compromised.</p>

<p>Do keep in mind, that Incapsula does not provide certainty but only gives your information about devices that are possible targets and devices that <em>might have been</em> infected. This is why it is important to realize that the Mirai however powerful attacks it can field it is not an unbeatable enemy on a small scope, it's even easy to prevent infections.</p>

<p>The next two sections will show that detecting is way too much effort compared to securing a device in the first place or securing your device on a hunch.</p>

<p><strong>Recapturing your device</strong></p>

<p>However, Mirai acts as an end point for a bot net and the worm is not changing the persistent memory of the IoT device. I.e. the firmware is not infected. This is the reason why <em>a reboot and an immediate password change</em> gives you back control over your device.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Infected systems can be cleaned by rebooting them, but since scanning for these devices happens at a constant rate, it’s possible for them to be reinfected within minutes of a reboot. This means users have to change the default password immediately after rebooting, or prevent the device from accessing the internet until they can reset the firmware and change the password locally.</p>

198,198,224.0,2.0,"<p>I've been reading about XMPP as a potential communications protocol for IoT devices but, after reading one source, I'm unsure whether it's really an appropriate protocol if you're concerned about overhead for each message.</p>

  <p>However, XMPP has a number of problems that make it somewhat undesirable for EMBEDDED IOT PROTOCOLS. As an XML-based protocol, XMPP is very verbose, even more so than HTTP, and has heavy data overhead. A single request/response exchange to send one byte of data from an IOT CONNECTED DEVICE to the server is more than 0.5 kB.</p>
  
  <p>There is a draft specification that would compress XMPP using an XML encoding called efficient XML Interchange (EXI). But even with EXI, the same one byte of data gets hundreds of bytes of protocol overhead from XMPP alone. EXI is also a much harder format to process than other options now available. Because of these inherent problems, it is generally recommended to avoid using XMPP in embedded IoT applications.</p>

<p>However, XMPP <a href=""http://xmpp.org/uses/internet-of-things.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">promotes itself as suitable for IoT applications</a> (although it doesn't specifically say that it's low-overhead), so it seems odd that such a large, seemingly verbose protocol would be recommended/promoted for IoT devices.</p>

200,200,,,"<p>While it's fair to say that XML is verbose, that should be tempered with the awareness that this verbosity is not all ""overhead"" in relation to content since it encapsulates semantics; it's overhead that's symptomatic of any protocol that emphasises a dynamic as opposed to static structure.  For example, HTML is really a relaxed form of XML that conveys content with a dynamic structure, structure that could be considered an aspect of the content.  You can distinguish the content of a table from the table itself, but the fact that the content is tabular data with specific relations is integral to the content; if I just took each cell and transmitted it all as one long string, that structure and those relationships are gone, and so I have lost information and isn't that content?</p>

<p>Let's consider an 8 byte message that might constitute some tabluar data.  If I use a very static protocol, I could, minimally, transmit that with no additional overhead simply by defining a protocol like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each message is exactly 8 bytes, so we don't need to indicate the length or include any terminating sequence.</li>
<li>The eight bytes are always taken to refer to a 2 x 2 grid where each cell contains a 16-bit value.</li>
</ul>

<p>If all my messages are exactly like that, using XML, HTML or XMPP might be considered silly — I am wasting bandwidth on structural components that are always the same and predetermined anyway, and wasting corresponding computation time at both ends creating and parsing it.  A minimal, proper HTML page that contains just a 2 x 2 table with a couple of characters in each cell is probably going to be at least 100 bytes to accommodate the formatting and protocol overhead.</p>

<p>However, if not all my messages are exactly that, then specifying what kind of message it is may not be a literal part of the ""payload"" but it is a necessary component, content-wise.  I could do that with just an extra two bytes and introduce much more dynamism:</p>

<ul>
<li>Messages are now variable length, 0-255 bytes, and the first byte indicates the length.</li>
<li>There are (up to) 256 codes for different predefined message types, one of which is ""2 x 2 table"", that's the second byte.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now my 8 bytes of table content require 2 bytes of overhead, but there is a much wider range of possibilities in terms of what kinds of messages can be sent with this custom protocol.</p>

<p>It's still nowhere close to the possibilities of an HTML page or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_namespace#Namespace_names"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">XML namespace</a> specification (or set thereof, which is <a href=""https://xmpp.org/registrar/namespaces.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">what XMPP essentially is</a>).</p>

<p>So, based on that, if mostly what you are doing is sending simple 8 byte messages, XMPP is probably overkill.  However, not necessarily that much.  The claim that ""a single request/response exchange to send one byte of data from an IOT CONNECTED DEVICE to the server is more than 0.5 kB"" seems to me, glancing at <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6120#section-8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the relevant RFC</a>, to be a potential exaggeration (but n.b., all I did is glance at it, I've never implemented or used XMPP). I don't doubt you could construct an example of such, but that is probably not a <em>minimal</em> example.</p>

<p>Since the protocol is TCP oriented, establishing ""an XML stream qualified by the 'jabber:client' namespace"" only needs to be considered part of the message if we are doing one off things — device contacts a server to send 8 bytes to, sends the data, disconnects.  If the relationship is more persistent, which it would often be in an IoT context, then we can assume the device already has an established connection to the destination.  In this case, if the ultimate destination of the message is the server (as opposed to another client the server is going to pass the message on to), then the protocol overhead is potentially minimal.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;message&gt;&lt;body&gt;8 bytes.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/message&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>A measly 33 bytes of ""overhead"".  It is worth pointing out here that XML is text, and so if your messages are often binary, then it is going to become much less appropriate, because that data needs to be encoded (e.g., to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">base64</a>), which adds further overhead and computational requirements.</p>

<p>So, ultimately:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does XMPP have a large overhead for IoT devices sending short, frequent messages?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there is a persistent connection and the messages are largely unstructured, I don't think so. However, if you don't need what it offers (the dynamism with regard to structure), then there are probably more appropriate methodologies. </p>

<p>Pursuit to that, if we have a context where a single central server is processing and/or relying messages between a variety of devices, even though what any one of those devices is doing may always be simple and straightforward, a protocol which can encapsulate a variety of messages would still be useful.  If a client device has limited resources, we can hardcode much of the protocol, and wrapping each message from that end becomes a very simple task; I believe many IoT devices which deploy HTTP servers do that (which is the inverse of ""simple clients, complex server"").  Those servers cannot handle any kind of HTTP request (except via preformatted rejection) and have a very well defined, focused set of things thing will do and responses they will send, but since they none-the-less function correctly as HTTP servers, implementing clients across a very broad range of commonplace devices (including smartphones and PCs) is simple.</p>

205,205,,,"<p>The simple answer is yes - you need enough blocks of flash to support bootloader and A/B code images if you want high reliability. Before activating the new image, you can write the whole thing, verify it and potentially retry.</p>

<p>However this <em>is</em> an expensive/reliable strategy and there are things you can do to reduce the overhead. Low level support for OTA updates may also come as part of the device firmware or OS, so you can avoid rolling-your-own unless you want to learn. This feature might be described as <code>FOTA</code>.</p>

<p>Partitioning your code base allows for incremental updates, best case the bootloader is able to bring up the network connection, download and verify code without needing any fall-back user code. With a local gateway, management of this task can be delegated from the low-cost endpoints.</p>

<p>Many devices have a small amount of word-erase flash, and even failing this you can usually <em>set</em> bits without needing to erase a whole block. These features can be used to manipulate jump tables and stitch together code which is updated in block sizes chunks. Even if you initially planned for a full A/B code space, you might need to fall back to a more complex scheme when the codebase grows too much.</p>

<p>To clarify the functionality which can be achieved with a sophisticated firmware-over-the-air solution, the bootloader and potentially a primary communication stack can remain resident whilst the full remaining user application space is re-flashed. This doesn't need any overhead (particularly if the block partitioning is soft). In the scenario where the communication stack needs to be upgraded, the region generally used for application code can be temporarily used during download and verification. Achieving this requires some support in the SoC, but 2nd and 3rd generation devices designed with this in mind do exist already.</p>

<p>It is called: <strong>Program Flash Memory Swap</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Systems using flash memory swap</strong></p>
  
  <p>In devices with two or more internal
  flash blocks that support swap, the memory base address of each flash
  block can be exchanged. The address location of each flash block will
  thus be swapped in the logical memory map of the device. After a
  reset, the built-in flash swap system essentially selects which
  software executes by the location of the flash block in the logical
  memory map. This allows a code back-up system with the added ease of
  programming. You can execute out of one block while
  erasing/programming the other block. On Kinetis devices, the flash
  swap system monitors/controls all the steps of switching from the old
  application to new; there is an added assurance of reliable operation
  in the case of a power loss during one of those steps.</p>
  
  <p>Advantages </p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Ease of programming. Application always executes out of the lower
  block in the memory map.</li>
  <li>Power loss tolerant.</li>
  <li>No bootloader
  required. No delay to the start of the main application.</li>
  <li>Well
  suited for a multi-tasking OS. Minimal application downtime. In a
  multi-tasking system it is possible to continue to execute the main
  application tasks while background tasks are running to update the new
  copy of the application.</li>
  <li>Backup copy of code. Possible to revert to
  the known working application.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Disadvantages</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Additional flash
  memory space required to store backup copy.</li>
  </ul>

208,208,,,"<p>In <a href=""https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/947.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""The Simon and Speck Block Ciphers on AVR 8-bit Microcontrollers""</a> <em>Beaulieu et al.</em> investigate the implementation of SIMON and SPECK on a low-end 8-bit microcontroller and compare the performance to other cyphers. An Atmel ATmega128 is used with 128 Kbytes of programmable flash memory, 4 Kbytes of SRAM, and thirty-two  8-bit general purpose registers.</p>

<p>Three encryption implementations are compared: </p>

<ol>
<li><em>RAM-minimizing</em> 

<blockquote>
  <p>These  implementations  avoid  the
  use of RAM to store round keys by including the pre-expanded round keys
  in the  flash program memory. No key schedule is included for updating this
  expanded key, making these implementations suitable for applications where
  the key is static.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><em>High-throughput/low-energy</em>

<blockquote>
  <p>These implementations
  include the key schedule and unroll enough copies of the round function in
  the encryption routine to achieve a throughput within about 3% of a fully-
  unrolled  implementation.  The  key,  stored  in   flash,  is  used  to  generate  the
  round keys which are subsequently stored in RAM.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><em>Flash-minimizing</em>

<blockquote>
  <p>The key schedule is included here.
  Space  limitations  mean  we  can  only  provide  an  incomplete  description  of
  these implementations. However, it should be noted that the previous two
  types of implementations already have very modest code sizes.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>To compare different cyphers a performance efficiency measure - <em>rank</em> - is used. The rank is proportional to throughput divided by memory usage.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SPECK ranks in the top spot for every block and key size which it supports. Except for the 128-bit block size, SIMON
  ranks second  for  all  block  and  key  sizes. </p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>Not surprisingly, AES-128 has very good performance on this platform, although for the same block and key size, SPECK has about twice the performance. For the same key size but with a 64-bit block size,
  SIMON and SPECK achieve two and four times better overall performance, respectively, than AES. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Comparing SPECK 128/128 to AES-128 the authors find that the memory footprint of SPECK is significantly reduced (460 bytes vs. 970 bytes) while throughput is only slightly decreased (171 cycles/byte vs. 146 cycles/byte).
Thus SPECK's performance (in the chosen metric) is higher than AES. Considering that speed is correlated with energy consumption the authors conclude that ""AES-128 may be a better choice in energy critical applications than SPECK 128/128 on this platform."" The authors however are uncertain whether heavy usage of RAM access (high-speed AES implementations) are more energy efficient than a register-based implementation of SPECK. In either case a significant reduction in flash memory usage can be achieved which might be of relevance on low-end microcontrollers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If  an  application  requires  high  speed,  and  memory  usage  is  not  a  priority, AES has the fastest implementation (using 1912 bytes of  flash, 432 bytes RAM) among  all  block  ciphers  with  a  128-bit  block  and  key  that  we  are  aware  of, with a cost of just 125 cycles/byte. The closest AES competitor is SPECK 128/128, with a cost of 138 cycles/byte for a fully unrolled implementation. Since speed is correlated with energy consumption, AES-128 may be a better choice in energy critical applications than SPECK 128/128 on this platform. However, if a 128-bit block is not required, as we might expect for many applications on
  an 8-bit microcontroller, then a more energy effcient solution (using 628 bytes of  flash, 108 bytes RAM) is SPECK 64/128 with the same key size as AES-128 and an encryption cost of just 122 cycles/byte, or SPECK
  64/96 with a cost of 118 cycles/byte.</p>

<p>trying to occupy the IoT space to <strong>move data from sensors</strong> to cloud easily with different approaches and as devices have limited connectivity, power, bandwidth, they need lighter weight protocol like MQTT and such which is pub-sub model based.</p>

<p>What my point here is any device that can sense and has data can use pub-sub but the <strong>smart</strong> thing comes from the type of implemnatation they are doing. Suppose if you are not using MQTT over some encrypted mechanism(TLS/SSL) , the data can be sniffed.</p>

<p>It depends on the application and the constraints the problem has and the so called smarter solution varies as time flies. One more thing to note here is that, having a <strong>smarter solution is not the smartest way</strong> to go around, because implementation is what matters the most and not the protocol or method you choose.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, it is possible to open the door from anywhere by publishing an event <strong>but</strong> this all depends on the application and authentication you are providing, for example you can make your application subscribing/publishing to topics is only after authentication.</p>

  <p>If your TrackR device and/or smart phone is sounding off at seemingly random times, you may have device and/or phone alerts enabled. When “Device alert” is enabled your TrackR device will sound off when the bluetooth connection betwen your TrackR and phone is off. Conversely, when ""Phone alert"" is enabled your phone will begin to ring when bluetooth connection between your TrackR and phone is lost. To remedy this issue you can turn off phone and device alerts from the TrackR app. To turn off the alerts please follow these steps:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>Open the TrackR app</p></li>
  <li><p>Click the icon in the top right corner of the app. This icon will look like 3 blocks stacked on top of each other.</p></li>
  <li><p>A menu will slide in with a list of each TrackR device you have connected with. Click the gear cog next to a listed TrackR device.</p></li>

218,218,,,"<p>Generally speaking you have to adjust the trigger for the motion detection. There's the sensitivity for the actual motion detection and that is as bravokeyl already says despite all technology most efficiently done by trial and error.</p>

<p>That might not work the same for all times of day due to low sun, clouds and other factors changing the lighting. Also cats. Motion detection and cats mix badly. Looking at the now provided options of your settings I'd start with deactivating the <em>low light sensitivity</em> box and check the results. At day and night. This might turn the camera useless at night, but that has to be tested with the actual device.</p>

<p>There is however another setting that might help you out that is listed in the handbook:</p>

  <p><strong>Interval</strong> Enter the time in minutes that must pass

<blockquote>
  <p>Wi-Fi HaLow will enable a variety of new power-efficient use cases in the Smart Home, connected car, and digital healthcare, as well as industrial, retail, agriculture, and Smart City environments.</p>
  
  <p>Wi-Fi HaLow extends Wi-Fi into the 900 MHz band, enabling the low power connectivity necessary for applications including sensor and wearables. Wi-Fi HaLow’s range is nearly twice that of today’s Wi-Fi, and will not only be capable of transmitting signals further, but also providing a more robust connection in challenging environments where the ability to more easily penetrate walls or other barriers is an important consideration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, as mentioned in the linked source, HaLow operates in the 900MHz frequency, which, according to <a href=""http://www.eweek.com/networking/halow-wifi-standard-brings-its-own-set-of-highs-and-lows-2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">eWeek</a>, is an unlicensed frequency:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unfortunately, the new HaLow standard doesn't have its frequencies to itself. Because the 900MHz band is shared with other licensed services, the new WiFi band is subject to interference from other users and there is no remedy when that interference happens.</p>
  
  <p>For example, if a ham radio operator next door goes on the air with a powerful signal that wipes out your smart thermostat, you're out of luck. Because you're an unlicensed service, you're required to accept that interference.</p>
  
  <p>However, if your smart thermostat happens to cause interference to that ham radio operator next door, then you're required to stop doing it. As an unlicensed user, you have few rights to the spectrum if someone else wants to use it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Presumably this is related to the <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7b9648f6ec90b7ebfad611bf26c88c34&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt47.1.15&amp;rgn=div5#se47.1.15_119"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FCC rules</a> which are commonly seen on RF products:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>UL describe their certification as involving:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Fuzz testing of products to identify zero day
  vulnerabilities over all interfaces</li>
  <li>Evaluation of known vulnerabilities on products that
  have not been patched using the Common Vulnerability
  Enumerations (CVE) scheme</li>
  <li>Identification of known malware on products</li>

  <li>Specific security controls identified for use in products
  that reduce the security risk [...]</li>
  <li>Structured penetration testing of products based on flaws
  identified in other tests</li>
  <li>Risk assessment of product security mitigation designed
  into products.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the <strong>exact</strong> process in which UL scrutinise devices is unclear (unless you pay to buy the full set of specifications), as Ars Technica note (and criticise):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When Ars requested a copy of the UL 2900 docs to take a closer look at the standard, UL (formerly known as Underwriters Laboratories) declined, indicating that if we wished to purchase a copy—retail price, around £600/$800 for the full set—we were welcome to do so. Independent security researchers are also, we must assume, welcome to become UL retail customers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although UL are respected, we <strong>cannot assume</strong> that their certification is particularly sound in terms of security without further scrutiny, though it does satisfy the original question.</p>

248,248,,,"<p>There are two advantages as far I know, here they are:</p>

<p>First: Snap packages can bring their own dependencies with them. So no dependency hell.</p>

<p>Second: Snap packages can be installed for one user only. So more control of who is running that software.</p>

  <p>Ubuntu Core is in many ways simply another flavor of Ubuntu (eg, the

  <ul>
  <li>The base system is a very minimal system that consists of three different parts: the kernel, gadget and OS which are all packaged and delivered using the new snap packaging format</li>
  <li>There is a clean separation between the base system and the applications installed on the system as well as a clean separation between installed applications</li>
  <li>Ubuntu Core replaces ‘apt’ with the new ‘snap’ command and applications are packaged and delivered as ‘snaps’</li>

259,259,,3.0,"<p>The motivation for this question comes from the fact that some time ago I created a simple proof of concept (PoC) IoT edge device using a microcontroller and a <a href=""http://www.ti.com/product/CC3100"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CC3100 Wifi network processor</a>. One of the problems with this prototype was that the configuration required a considerable amount power. Thus, it could not overcome the benefits of the existing lower power device which could last for over 2 to 10 years depending on choice of battery and usage frequency.</p>

<p>Depending on the application, the current product uses a 6V DC battery with a capacity between 1400 mAh and 2400 mAh. The device has a low power sensing element and an actuating mechanism. The payload most likely will be around 100 bytes. The frequency of communication will be about every two minutes during peak activity. With the advances in the IoT and market demands, this PoC has gained some attention.</p>

<p>Per the suggestion of few IOT platform providers I am looking at <a href=""http://www.ti.com/product/CC3200"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CC3200 wireless MCU</a> from Texas Instrument primarily because it is the successor to the CC3100. At a system level when not in use the CC3100 power can be completely switched off. This is a significant advantage for low power at a systems level. When activity is detected the sensing element wakes up the microcontroller via an interrupt. There are other integrated wifi MCU’s such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ESP8266</a>, <a href=""http://www.cypress.com/products/ieee-80211-abgn-wlan-sdio-usb-and-mimo"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BCM43362</a>, <a href=""http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-42487-ATWINC1500B-MU_Datasheet.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ATWINC1500B</a>, <a href=""http://www.marvell.com/microcontrollers/88MC200/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">88MC200</a> and many more. I use <a href=""http://www.eembc.org/ulpbench/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ULPBench Scores</a> to do a first order analysis of low power microcontrollers followed by analysis such as described in <a href=""http://engineering.stackexchange.com/questions/1987/how-to-select-a-micro-controller-for-a-low-power-application/10606#10606"">How to select a micro controller for a low power application?</a>  to help select a low power microcontroller. I have used parameters such as active mode current draw per frequency, and current draw a different low power modes to make an informed selection. So in order to maintain the low power option and to add IoT capability, what are critical parameters (may related to wireless communication) that I should I pay close attention to when selecting an integrated wifi MCU?</p>

<p><strong>Wired mesh network vs. star topology</strong></p>

<p>Well, the Internet is a mesh network. Why? Because DARPA wanted it to work even if half the United States were bombed into oblivion if the cold war was going hot. The military wanted a highly reliable network that is not dependent on any single node. Meshing or at least partial meshing your network nodes will give you that reliability. The major drawback of (wired) mesh networks is that they are not very cost efficient. They cost a lot. Cabling every component to every other component is just too expensive. So the WAN backbone of the Internet of Things is already a <em>wired</em> mesh network.</p>

<p>Star topology is needs just one cable per node, while meshing uses up to n*(n-1)/2 for a full mesh. The cabling for mesh networks gets a lot more expensive very fast. Thus, star topology emerged as the dominant standard.</p>

<p><strong>Now (mostly) new, wireless mesh networks</strong></p>

<p>Establishing <em>wireless</em> mesh networks circumvents the major drawback of <em>wired</em> mesh networks. There is no cabling cost to create a wireless mesh network. Thus, creating wireless mesh networks pairs the reliability network creators always wanted with the low cost of few cables and of course all the other advantages of being wireless.</p>

<p>However there are still a few drawbacks of mesh networks. Nodes have to be relatively smart for the routing compared to simply connecting to one central node. ZigBee uses <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_On-Demand_Distance_Vector_Routing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing</a>, which requires routing tables at each node. Also a certain duplex capability of the nodes is required to make the network efficient. Bringing that on a low-cost, wireless-capable microchip took some time. Today we have those chips.</p>

<p>For a mesh network to work properly there have to be enough nodes. It actually gets more efficient with more nodes (that connect to at least two existing ones). Thus, the Internet of Things were everything can act as a node is an obvious match for meshed networks. While other topologies would possibly clog up with more nodes mesh networks really start to shine there and get faster and more reliable the more nodes are added.</p>

<p><strong>Your 10-20 node network</strong></p>

<p>For a smart home setting with one or two dozen devices there are a few things to consider regarding topology. Firstly, ZigBee actually supports star topology as well. Secondly, any sort of distance vector routing usually works with weighted vector values. Thus, in a smart home setting the direct connection could very well be rated highest and you'll end up with a defact star topology even when it's configured as a mesh.</p>

<p><em>Only the device that are out of range of a central component like a Hue Bridge (or rate the direct connection bad enough) will even make use of the mesh topology. For these devices <strong>mesh networking is essentially a low latency range extension</strong> for your network. Thus, you don't have to buy another central node. That saves money. So the same thing that killed wide spread wired mesh networks before makes wireless mesh networks so attractive today. Economics.</em></p>

269,269,,,"<p>Mesh networks tend to give better local configuration options for an IoT network.

271,271,,,"<p>Yes, it is possible to subscribe to a topic that is created by itself. </p>

<p>A possible use case (I assume) is that, suppose if there are three clients (x,y,z) subscribed to a topic <code>x-topic</code> created by <code>x</code>. Whenever a message is published on <code>x-topic</code>, everyone subscribed to that topic will receive the message. If <code>y</code> publishes a message to a topic <code>x-topic</code> (I presume that can be done), if <code>x</code> doesn't subscribe to that topic even though it created the topic, it won't receive the messages.</p>

272,272,,,"<p>According to <a href=""https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/snappy/start/gadget-snaps/"">developer.ubuntu.com</a>, there are basically <strong>two purposes</strong>:</p>

<p><strong><em>- Declare hardware capabilities to the system</em></strong></p>

<p>Quoting from <a href=""https://docs.ubuntu.com/core/en/guides/build-device/gadget"">Ubuntu Documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The gadget snap is responsible for defining and manipulating the system properties which are specific to one or more devices that will usually look similar to one another from an implementation perspective. This snap must necessarily be produced and signed by the device brand, which is defined via the model assertion. The brand knows where and how that device will be used, and designs the gadget snap accordingly.</p>
  
  <p>For example, the brand may know that the device is actually a special VM to be used on a particular cloud, or it may know that it is going to be manufactured in a particular factory. The gadget snap may encode the mechanisms for device initialization - key generation and identity certification - as well as particular processes for the lifecycle of the device, such as factory resets. It is perfectly possible for different models to share a gadget snap.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>- Pre-allow access to snaps that need to use this hardware</em></strong></p>

<p>Also from the <a href=""https://docs.ubuntu.com/core/en/guides/build-device/gadget"">Ubuntu Documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The optional prepare-device <a href=""https://docs.ubuntu.com/core/en/guides/build-device/config-hooks"">hook</a> is a script that will be called on the gadget at the start of the device initialization process, after the gadget snap has been installed. The hook will also be called if this process is retried later from scratch in case of initialization failures.</p>
  
  <p>The device initialization process is for example responsible of setting the serial identification of the device through an exchange with a device service. The prepare-device hook can for example redirect this exchange and dynamically set options relevant to it.</p>

273,273,,,"<p>If you want a totally independent switch in case of the microcontroller fails, then you can hook-up an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_gate"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">XOR gate</a> for two inputs. The relay will be off when both inputs are the same, and on if the inputs are different. The two inputs are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Regular switch for manual control.</li>
<li>Output from an MCU for automatic or remote control.</li>
</ol>

<p>The circuit:</p>

<p>Normally the switch should be open (input B is low just like on the image above) and the N-FET is driven by the MCU pin. When the MCU pin is low, then the XOR gate outputs low because the inputs match(both low) and the relay will be turned off. When the MCU pin is high, the relay will be turned on because the inputs are different.</p>

<p>Now if the MCU crashes and its pin stucks in a state, then there are two cases:</p>

<ol>
<li>MCU pin stucks in high state and the relay remains turned on. In this case switch will give you an ability to control the relay as follows. If the switch is open then the relay will turned on, and if the switch is closed the relay will turned off.</li>
<li>The MCU pin stucks in low state. In this case an open switch will turn off the relay and a closed will turn it on.</li>

<p><strong>Some remarks about safety</strong>. If you decide to switch mains voltage then it is <a href=""http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/55719/is-switching-the-neutral-ok"">recommended to switch the hot mains wire</a> rather than the neutral.</p>

<p>The best would be to use an SPDT relay to make sure and switch hot and neutral as well.</p>

<p>Instead of a MOSFET you could use an opto-isolator to isolate the digital circuit and the manual switch from the relay and mains.</p>

293,293,,,"<p>After some further investigation, I think the issue in the question is that although the <strong>power</strong> (rate of energy transfer) was reduced, the overall <strong>energy consumption</strong> was increased by using Docker, so there is no benefit in terms of reduced electricity costs.</p>

<p>Based on the paper's figures for 100,000 requests, we can calculate the energy usage through the formula:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Energy = power x time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given that the native code consumed 2.4893 W of power, and took approximately 170 seconds (see Figure 3, Native 200), we know that the energy used was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2.4893 W * 170 s</p>
  
  <p>= 423.181 Ws = 423.181 J (1 watt-second is equivalent to a joule, or, in other words, a watt is a joule per second)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the Docker code, the power usage was 2.3642 W, but the time taken was 220 seconds, so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2.3642 W * 220 s</p>
  
  <p>= 520.124 Ws = 520.124 J</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hence, the overall energy usage for the example was 96.943 J higher, which is clearly undesirable if energy usage is a concern. However, using Docker does have other advantages for deployment and management, but in <strong>tightly constrained</strong> environments (e.g. battery-only), it would seem that it is best avoided.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Kirkland, Washington – June 16, 2016 –</strong> The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) announced that its next release, coming late 2016 to early 2017, will be called Bluetooth 5 and will include significantly increased range, speed, and broadcast messaging capacity. Extending range will deliver robust, reliable Internet of Things (IoT) connections that make full-home and building and outdoor use cases a reality. Higher speeds will send data faster and optimize responsiveness. Increasing broadcast capacity will propel the next generation of “connectionless” services like beacons and location-relevant information and navigation. These Bluetooth advancements open up more possibilities and enable SIG companies – now at an all-time high of 30,000 member companies – to build an accessible, interoperable IoT.</p>

<p>As others have pointed out I trade off bandwidth, range and cost. But with this new promising Bluetooth release I will get the following advantages according to <a href=""http://e2e.ti.com/blogs_/b/connecting_wirelessly/archive/2016/06/22/bluetooth-5-will-unlock-the-power-of-the-simplelink-cc2640-wireless-mcu?hootPostID=e982e464076614be2ac05b1f2b814f8e"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Texas Instruments</a>.

<ol>
<li><blockquote>
  <p><strong>Longer range</strong> will enable point-to-point and star networks to provide reliable, whole-house coverage for smart home applications such as security systems, lighting, smoke detectors and door locks. TI’s SimpleLink ultra-low power wireless MCUs provide industry leading RF performance to enable longer range and more robust connectivity today, and will introduce up to four times longer range with Bluetooth 5. Longer range will also be a huge advantage in mesh networks, reducing the number of hops necessary to transfer packets between nodes, which in turn reduces network congestion and improves stability.</p>

  <p><strong>Higher speeds</strong> will enable data transfer at twice the rate while improving spectral and energy efficiency and enable new higher throughput applications such as audio. Transferring large amounts of data, for instance in medical, sports and fitness applications, will also be much faster providing a better overall user experience. When combined with data length extension in Bluetooth 4.2, which is already supported on CC2640 devices, higher speeds from Bluetooth 5 will provide 500 percent increased data throughput over Bluetooth 4.0. Today, TI’s CC2640 wireless MCU supports up to 5Mbps communication.</p>

That was the purpose. Only there is a limitation on the maximum weights:</p>

</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>As for training, as far as I understand the implementation described, the PIC controller receives parameters from an external source.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The  neural  network  forward  calculations  are  written  so  that  each  neuron  is  calculated  individually  in  a  series  of  nested  loops.  The number of calculations for each loop and values for  each  node  are  all  stored  in  a  simple  array  in  memory.</p>

The  microcontroller  could  easily  be  modified  to  contain  a  simple  boot  loader  that  makes  use  of  the  onboard  RS232  serial  port  which  would  receive  the  data for the weights and topography from a remote location.  This would allow for the weights or even the entire network 
  to be modified while the chip is in the field.  </p>

306,306,,,"<p><strong>Yes, Mosquitto does support multiple brokers.</strong></p>

<p>Mosquitto uses <a href=""https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto-conf-5.html"">MQTT Bridges</a> to connect multiple brokers thus routing messages between these mosquitto brokers. This way a bridge between your primary broker to a fallback system can be established. Avoid creating loops though. If both brokers run your clients publish to the primary broker which then publishes the topic to each and any subscriber including the bridged secondary broker. If the primary fails your clients will note (Connection Refused, Server unavailable) and can fallback to directly publish to the secondary. (I am not yet sure how to fix it the other way round.) As you're not expecting the client to disconnect ungracefully I think that ""Last Will and Testament"" do not apply here (it would be used to have the broker notify on behalf of a disconnected client).</p>

<p>This <a href=""https://www.quora.com/How-does-the-MQTT-mosquitto-work-with-multiple-brokers"">post</a> however lists the drawbacks of this approach especially with respect to scalability and availability:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>The bridge routing mechanisms don’t scale well if you forward all messages to the other bridges</li>
  <li>The communication overhead between bridges is significant if you’re using QoS 2 between bridges (which you need to do if you want to propagate messages between clients that are connected to different bridges)</li>
  <li>There is no failover and high availability. If a broker bridge crashes, messages may get lost</li>
  <li>MQTT clients cannot be migrated to other bridge nodes. MQTT sessions are not replicated across bridges, so you will lose all your queued messages and subscriptions if you’re using MQTT persistent sessions.</li>

307,307,,,"<p>As your most important constraint is having a low power consumption, I think you are already paying attention to the 2 most important parameters: active mode current draw per frequency, and current draw at the different low power modes.</p>

<p>Holding the communication as a constant (i.e. same communication protocol and EM frequency), then choosing the best MCU is just a matter of aggregating those two parameters properly. And here's how I would create a single numeric value I could compare across all options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a projected activity profile for the device (how often does it communicate and for how long) over a period - say over a week.</li>
<li>Compute the current draw at the EM frequency used for the times over the selected period when communication is active - i.e. 10 uA draw (@ 900 MHz frequency) for a 2 s duration at 1000 x activity in a week would mean 20,000 uA-s / week.</li>
<li>Compute the current draw for the times over the selected period when the device is at its default low power mode - i.e. 10 nA draw at [7 days x 24 hrs x 60 mins x 60 s - 1000 x 2 s activity] would mean 6,028 uA-s / week.</li>
<li>Adding the 2 yields 26,028 uA-s / week current draw for this hypothetical MCU.</li>
<li>This computed weekly current draw can then be compared for all MCUs.</li>
</ol>

<p>I know this is a very simplistic way of viewing the MCU activity - i.e. just considered 2 states: idle and communicating... but I believe any other states will have proportional and minor contributions to one of these 2. For instance, power used up for computations (instruction cycles) can be bundled along with the communicating state and will most likely have a very small contribution in terms of power as compared to the communication sub-system. The point is that, looking at these 2 states is sufficient for the selection process.</p>

The reason is that often the subscribing client is not able to process the load of messages that is coming its way. Especially if you have a massive throughput. Our recommended solution is to implement an extension in the MQTT broker, for example the plugin system of HiveMQ allows you to hook into the behavior of HiveMQ and add a asynchronous routine to process each incoming message and persist it to a database.</p>

  <p>I want to reduce the need to flash everything and risk bricking the device completely as much as possible. Are there existing strategies when flashing microcontrollers over the air?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aside from your code that does the updating which would be relatively static, you need to keep two images in your storage: an active image and a backup image. Whenever, you need to update, do it in the backup, then switch that to be active. Once stable, update the old active image which should now be your backup.</p>

<p>With that in mind, you can use wear-leveling algorithms when updating both images. The code for such algorithms might take around 10-15% of the total storage, but it's well worth it in extending the device's lifespan.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wear leveling is typically managed by the flash controller, which uses a wear leveling algorithm to determine which physical block to use each time data is programmed. There are two types of solid-state drive (SSD) wear leveling: dynamic and static. Dynamic wear leveling pools erased blocks and selects the block with the lowest erase count for the next write.</p>
  
  <p>Static wear leveling, on the other hand, selects the target block with
  the lowest overall erase count, erases the block if necessary, writes
  new data to the block, and ensures that blocks of static data are
  moved when their block erase count is below a certain threshold. This
  additional step of moving data can slow write performance due to
  overhead on the flash controller, but static wear leveling is
  considerably more effective than dynamic wear leveling for extending
  the lifespan of solid state devices.</p>

330,330,,,"<p><strong>Yes and no.</strong></p>

<p>Both technologies are concerning different levels of providing connectivity. Usually mesh networking is provided by level 3 or 4 or even both of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model#Description_of_OSI_layers"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ISO OSI model</a>, depending on the extend of implementation. The network and transport layers provide the basic reliability of the mesh network. That reliability is usually not impeded when a node drops off.</p>

<p>MQTT and AMQP are application layer protocols on level 7. Therefore these protocols are dependent on the reliability of the lower levels as far as the basic model goes. However it's always the prerogative of higher OSI levels to implement safeguards to cope with failures of the lower levels. For example the application can switch to a completely different network, like from Wi-Fi to 4G for example if it detects network failure. Smartphones do it all the time when we enter or leave a place with a configured Wi-Fi.</p>

<p>There are also possibilities for the lower levels to accommodate for failures in upper levels. OSI level 4 load balancing for example can accommodate for failing nodes behind it. Of course, that requires that each nodes that can be addressed for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">load balancing</a> and or failover solutions can provide the same service. Also obviously you need the <em>central component</em> at least twice. Since <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MQTT</a> is basically application level routing based on topics that should be possible by simple duplication. This is <a href=""http://www.hivemq.com/blog/building-a-high-availability-mqtt-cluster"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an example of an MQTT cluster solution</a> with the HiveMQ implementation.</p>

<p>With that in mind it can be concluded that, <strong>no</strong>, <em>the reliability on the network and transport levels cannot be negated by the choice of any higher level protocols.</em> However that does not apply to the user experience. For the user the lower level protocols are just vehicles. Using an application layer protocol that has a single point of failure still means, that if that node is broken, then <strong>yes</strong>, <em>the functionality is broken even though my network is still working.</em></p>

<p>Anyhow, the application layer and above are responsible to provide the reliability to the user. Mesh networks can only deliver the basics. </p>

<p><em>There is one final thing to consider. Unless one has redundancies for every component, there are always use cases that have single points of failure. It's most likely the node the user actually interacts with. In home automation for example every failing node very likely means that one just lost a use case.</em></p>

334,334,,1.0,"<p>I have a more or less dumb TV (Toshiba 42SL863G) and home cinema system (LG HX806SG) which I want to control via Alexa voice command.

<p>The best solution I could find so far would entail a Raspberry Pi and enhance it with a custom build infrared transceiver like the one <a href=""http://alexba.in/blog/2013/06/08/open-source-universal-remote-parts-and-pictures/"">detailed here</a>. Thus, I'd have a Raspberry Pi which I could then use with the <a href=""http://alexba.in/blog/2013/01/06/setting-up-lirc-on-the-raspberrypi/"">LIRC library</a> to control my dumb devices. Of course, I'd need to find out all the IR codes and then write a few scripts to trigger them in a sequence to set a mode like TV mode or home cinema mode.</p>

<p>The next step would then be to either outfit my future Pi with a <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00E6300DO"">ZigBee module</a> or <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00I8SVMY4"">Z-Wave module</a> and try to fake being a generic smart home device for Alexa or write a custom Alexa skill to trigger the Raspberry Pi scripts somehow.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.logitech.com/en-gb/product/harmony-hub?crid=60"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Logitech Harmony Hub</a> seems to take a very similar approach of simply sending infrared signals to control 'dumb' devices (just like a traditional universal remote would), so it seems likely that your approach of using an infrared transmitter is correct (otherwise Logitech would have likely gone with a different solution to the problem!).</p>

<p>From the Logitech website, here's a description of how the Harmony Hub operates:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CLOSED CABINET CONTROL</p>
  
  <p>Control your devices behind closed cabinets and doors with IR, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth® wireless.</p>

<p>For your specific use case, infrared (IR) is the only transmission type you need, since your TV and home cinema don't support the other methods.</p>

<p>However, on this note, it may be worth considering whether it's actually worth building it yourself as opposed to just buying the pre-built solution from Logitech for this purpose. I've checked compatibility for you using the <a href=""https://support.myharmony.com/en-gb/compatibility"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">compatibility checker</a> and both your devices are listed as supported, and your method of using the Pi may be similarly expensive (but will also require the trouble of designing the software and finding the IR codes):</p>

<p>When you total these, the price comes to approximately £57.70, which saves £41.30 compared to the Logitech Harmony Hub, but you will have to spend time designing the software to control the IR transmitter/receiver and the Alexa skill. Alternatively, if you decide to integrate it with SmartThings with the ZigBee/Z-Wave components you listed, the totals will be approximately £84 and <strong>£114</strong> for the whole device (the latter is <strong>more</strong> than the £99 Logitech Hub!).</p>

<p>You may be able to reduce the price significantly, though, by using a more simple microcontroller, since I doubt it will be so complex that a Raspberry Pi 3 would be required.</p>

<p>In summary, if you're in for a challenge and don't mind getting your hands dirty, you could save quite a lot of money by designing it yourself (as long as you avoid the <strong>really expensive components</strong>).

<p><strong>No on the sending. But yes on the recording.</strong></p>

<p>I'm currently developing an Alexa hardware client for a company. The device is always listening. But you'd have to put in a wake word engine on it so that it would ""wake up"" from the passive listening mode and switch to active ""listen for command"" mode.</p>

<p>The firmware would only send the statements after the wake word (switch to active mode) into the cloud to process them as commands.</p>

<ul>
<li>As far as the device is concerned, you wouldn't want to send every statement it gets into the cloud for processing because that would consume too much bandwidth and power.</li>

<p>Therefore I would like to understand the underlying architecture of servers that service IoT devices. Broadly speaking IoT devices connect service which services data and make the information available of use by other devices. This is pretty straightforward.</p>

<p>For now the possible IoT edge devices will use Wi-Fi, but plan to migrate to a low data rate, low power protocol such as ZigBee, BLE, or might be Z-Wave, at which point I will require a some type of hub. The data payload will be about 100 bytes, at peak the transmission could as high as one transaction per minute.  The IoT edge devices will mostly upload data, with an occasional download to the devices.  </p>

<p>It has been suggested that I look into <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT"" rel=""noreferrer"">MQTT</a>, and <a href=""https://www.rabbitmq.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">RabbitMQ</a> as possible options.

  <p>Should I use Mosquitto's web sockets or connect clients directly?</p>

<p>How long is  a piece of string? (YMMV)</p>

<p>I can only speak generally, but I always prefer wrapper libraries to raw sockets (or, indeed, to coding anything which I can get for free from a library). </p>

<p>They make coding simpler and less error prone. They take care of a lot of house-keeping and error handling, which is code that you would have to write and debug yourself, where as a library has generally been well reviewed and tested and is being used by thousands of others, all of whom will report/fix bugs for you. </p>

<p>Plus, it is less code for you to maintain (and, possibly, port), which means more time to develop, test &amp; polish your app, or move on to the next one.</p>

<p>The only overhead is arguably a function call, if you accept that all that librarian goodness (error handling, hose-keeping &amp; the like) is something that you would have to code yourself in order to get good, stable, software.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about performance, just profile. But, unless your socket is active hundreds of times a second, I would not even bother.</p>

<li><p>Accept interference. One of the constraints of an amateur license is that continuous transmission is restricted.

The impact of this is that maybe you will be denied connectivity for short periods, but this is unlikely to persist for a long period.

388,388,,,"<p>The WiFi we know and use now also share the 2.4 GHz frequency range with a lot of other technologies and applications which might interfere. If we have a look on the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2.4_GHz_radio_use"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">list of 2.4 GHz radio usage</a>, a couple of items are there beside WiFi.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Many cordless telephones and baby monitors in the United States and Canada use the 2.4GHz frequency, the same frequency at which Wi-Fi standards 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n operate.</li>
  <li>Bluetooth devices intended for use in short-range personal area networks operate from 2.4 to 2.4835 GHz.</li>
  <li>Certain car manufacturers use the 2.4 GHz frequency for their car alarm internal movement sensors. These devices transmit on 2.45 GHz (between channels 8 and 9) at a strength of 500 mW.</li>
  <li><p>ZigBee</p></li>
  <li><p>My wireless mouse and keyboard.</p></li>
  </ul>

<p>Moreover the 2.4 GHz band has the following <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">licensed users</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>FIXED, MOBILE, RADIOLOCATION, Amateur &amp; Amateur-satellite service</p>

<p>So accepting interference is pretty much the case right now too.</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/4/10691400/new-wifi-halow-standard-announced-iot-ces-2016"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Verge's article, ""There's a new type of Wi-Fi, and it's designed to connect your smart home""</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It'll be in the 900MHz range, which has better reach and penetration than the 2.4GHz and 5GHz range that existing Wi-Fi operates in. (But, like existing Wi-Fi, it'll be in operating in unlicensed spectrum, so there may be interferences.) There does, of course, have to be a downside. And there is: HaLow isn't going to be as good at quickly transferring data. <strong>This isn't Wi-Fi for browsing the web; it's for transferring small bits of data on infrequent occasions</strong>. Device manufacturers can, to some extent, customize HaLow to their needs to get faster transfers, but that'll happen at the expense of battery life.</p>

<p>So as WiFi HaLow is designed for lower bandwidth and for battry saving low-power applications it might a be better solution if we are already talking about interference. As it is intended to transfer less data then original WiFi.</p>

389,389,,5.0,"<p><strong>Scenario</strong></p>

<p>After the helpful answers to my <a href=""https://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/379/what-can-i-actually-do-with-a-harmony-hub"">last question</a> I got myself a <a href=""https://secure.logitech.com/en-us/product/harmony-hub?crid=60"" rel=""noreferrer"">Harmony Hub</a> and it works as I want it to. Basically, it remembers the state of the devices and uses infrared signals to fake the remotes and change to the configured settings when I activate a setup like <em>Watch Fire TV</em> or <em>Watch Blu-Ray</em>. Those two require different input settings for the TV (Toshiba 42SL863G).</p>

<p>However, my second home automation stage is screwing things up a bit. As it turns out my TV defaults to a different base setting when it is shut off compared to losing mains power. Since I want to shut down the whole media circus via smart plug I have two starting points.</p>

<ol>
<li>Powering up

<ul>
<li>The TV starts automatically</li>
<li>The Fire TV starts automatically and makes the TV switch to the HDMI it's connected to. </li>
<li>Surround System doesn't start.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Just off after being in a known state (TV input either HDMI 1 or 2)

<ul>
<li>I start everything by Harmony and the devices go to the desired states</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>The Harmony Hub doesn't know if the power was off and cannot properly set the input channel. The remote or Harmony does not have a button that just says HDMI 1 or 2. Keeping all the equipment on is not a desired solution. Furthermore I triggering the whole setup via voice command, so I don't have a display that would allow me to see what mode I had been in before.</p>

390,390,,,"<p>Apparently not. <a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/article/alexa-times-two-can-two-amazon-echos-find-love-and-happiness-in-one-home/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This blog discusses the current impossibility of the synchronized alarms.</a> I couldn't find any information that suggests that they changed it by now. However as the blog discusses, it means that you can set one alarm and one timer per Echo, which multiplies your available timers and alarms. Alas, that's not your goal.</p>

<p>I checked the usual suspects, but IFTTT does not offer the <em>that-branch</em> for Alexa. It also seems to be incapable of just playing your voice back and thus making the voice output of the one Alexa the input of the other one. However that would mean a delay for a timer, since timers are relative times. Moreover, this would only work with different wake words, since otherwise the Echos don't react both (cf. <a href=""http://www.howtogeek.com/262664/what-you-can-and-cant-do-with-multiple-amazon-echos/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This blog</a>). Only the nearest will respond. That also eliminates the possibility to just speak somewhere where all Echos can hear you.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you have more than one device using the same wake word, <strong><em>Alexa responds intelligently from the Echo you're closest to with ESP (Echo Spatial Perception)</em></strong>, and performs the requested task.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202013740"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Amazon Documentation</a>, emphasis mine)</p>

<p>The page also confirms that the alarms are device specific.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some content is not common between devices on the same account, including:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Alarms and timers</li>
  <li>Sounds</li>
  <li>Bluetooth connections</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The following solidifies even more that there is no off-the-shelf solution for the dual alarms.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot connect multiple Alexa devices to each other and play the same requested audio at the same time.</p>

408,408,,,"<p>I know you <em>want</em> to use the plug to shut off the entire media center to eliminate the expense (and waste) of the standby power draw, but I would strongly recommend the simpler solution of leaving the TV plugged in 24/7, and triggering your TV's power setting using the same event that activates your smart plug.  </p>

<h2><strong>Power/Cost</strong></h2>

<p>Modern LCD or OLED TVs sip about half a watt of current in standby, or less.  <a href=""https://www.manualscat.com/en/toshiba-42sl863g-manual"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">According to your TV's manual</a> (on page 100), your TV draws 0.2W of power in standby.  Using your figure of 0.28€/kW as a cost of electricity, the standby power drawn by your TV will add no more than 0.49€ per year to your electric bill.  Given the life of a TV may be 20 years, that means your workaround would have to cost less than 10.00€ to ever pay for itself.  Furthermore, your TV will consume electricity at the full-power rate of 131/kWh during the entire system's cold boot sequence, which probably takes more time than a warm boot.  (The longer it takes your whole system to boot up to ""watchable TV"", the more useless electricity it draws; similarly, I've found that family members are typically less pleased the longer it takes for the TV to power up.)</p>

<p>Financially, there is little reason to pursue this. Environmentally, it is probably not as advantageous as you think.</p>

<h2>Safety</h2>

<p>Smart plugs are not rated to isolate their plugged-in devices from lightning strikes, so merely shutting off the smart plug won't protect the TV from surges or spikes.</p>

<h2>Privacy</h2>

<p>If you're concerned about privacy and network activity while your smart TV is supposed to be ""powered off"", go into your TV's settings and disable the phone home capabilities.  If you're still worried, powering it off won't help because they leak personal data when they're on (and you're watching it), not when they're in standby.  In that case you should instead fix the leak by shielding the TV behind a network firewall that prevents it from ever reporting back to the factory. </p>

409,409,441.0,1.0,"<p>I have recently read an <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/28/decentralizing-iot-networks-through-blockchain/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a> about why IoT should switch from the now dominant centralized (server - client) model to a decentralized peer-to-peer solution.</p>

<p>Reasons against centralization:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Connection between devices <strong>will have to exclusively go through the internet</strong>, even if they happen to be a few feet apart.</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>it <strong>will not be able to respond</strong> to the growing needs of the huge IoT ecosystems of tomorrow</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p><strong>Existing IoT solutions are expensive</strong> because of the high infrastructure and maintenance cost associated with centralized clouds, large server farms and networking equipment. The sheer amount of communications that will have to be handled when IoT devices grow to the tens of billions will increase those costs substantially.</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>Even if the unprecedented economical and engineering challenges are overcome, <strong>cloud servers will remain a bottleneck</strong> and point of failure that can disrupt the entire network. This is especially important as more critical tasks such as human health and life will become dependent on IoT.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead the article suggests a decentralized approach to IoT networking using peer-to-peer communication. But:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, establishing peer-to-peer communications will present its own set of challenges, <strong>chief among them the issue of security</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other source, like <a href=""https://www.hackable.io/blog/how-p2p-becoming-iot-nightmare"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">How Is P2P Becoming the IoT Nightmare?</a> also mentions security as a problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It seems that the P2P (peer-to-peer) communication capabilities embedded into some Internet of Things devices turns into a security headache for users.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So security is clearly an issue to be solved, but what else should I care about when choosing to use a decentralized P2P network?</p>

410,410,,,"<p>A lot of people have struggled with this.  No charter appears to be forthcoming, because the interests of the cloud providers lies in locking their hardware users in, based on the potential future profits to be made from subscribers.  The more dependent you are upon their cloud, the more you'll be theoretically willing to pay for continued service (note that payment already includes non-monetary transactions such as targeted advertising and data collection.)  So don't expect any of the cloud-based solutions to champion an exit strategy.</p>

<p>So for now, you can overcome your reluctance by taking matters into your own hands.  Your best defense is to purchase independent items that comply with standards (open or proprietary), as opposed to being run by proprietary clouds.  </p>

<p>Let's look at three examples:  cloud-based, proprietary network, open network.</p>

<h2>Cloud-based</h2>

<p>AssureLink is a proprietary wireless network that uses a home hub to connect to a cloud-based service to provide remote access to one brand of garage door openers.  When these openers were released on the market, a subscription to AssureLink cost $19.00 per year, and there were few sales.  The company dropped charging for the service so they haven't gone away, but there is always concern that once they've saturated the market, the company will have no reason to continue the service, at which point the devices would become useless.  </p>

<p>This concern is not without merit.</p>

<p>Pebble's recent acquisition by Fitbit has thrust them into the spotlight, but Revolv was the previous poster child for IoT devices being bricked by their parent company.  The Revolv home hub connected to a proprietary cloud service.  Google bought Nest, and then bought Revolv to get some of the people.  They saw Revolv as splintering the home automation market away from Nest so they shut it down, bricking every Revolv home controller.</p>

<p>Is this true for all cloud-based hardware?  Apple, Google, and Amazon are all as stable as any provider can be.  But Revolv sure looked good when Google first bought them; Nest is reportedly in disarray internally (and Google's new hub is pitted directly against Nest's philosophy), and you only have to look as far as Microsoft's Zune or Phone to see that being big doesn't mean that a centralized service will remain successful over the life of your devices. </p>

<h2>Proprietary P2P network standard</h2>

<p>Z-Wave is an example of a proprietary mesh network technology.  Z-Wave devices can talk to each other, but each device requires a communications chip licensed by a single company.  Development and per-chip licenses are ridiculously expensive, so the price of the devices will never come down until the patents expire, and even then only if someone else enters the market to compete with them.  However, once you have a Z-Wave device, it will continue to work with new and old Z-Wave devices.</p>

<h2>Open P2P network</h2>

<p>WiFi based cameras are a good example of devices based on open network technology.  Apps for smart phones can connect directly to the camera, no cloud required, no expensive licensed technology. However, these have drawbacks.  In order to use these devices without a cloud, the installer has to configure their router/firewall to enable remote access.  And as we've seen with the Mirai botnet, these devices are responsible for their own security but not all do a good job of it, and they even put the rest of your network at risk.</p>

<h2>The future with Open Source</h2>

<p>The open source answer to this are projects like OpenHab, Domoticz, mosquitto, and others.  Instead of a proprietary cloud, you run the P2P devices from your own server.  Only the server is exposed to the internet, and for the most part these are positioned to be better hardened.  At this point this approach is still very much in its infancy, and all the solutions so far require some technical skills to set up and maintain a home network.</p>

<p>However, by focusing on P2P devices today, whether they use an open or closed protocol, you are at least investing in building your own infrastructure that will work free of the dependency on proprietary external services.  You can even get started with a proprietary home hub, as long as the devices are communicating via a P2P standard that exists beyond a single company.  The open source solutions can't get any worse than they are right now, and are rapidly improving.</p>

413,413,,,"<p>There are a few things that really distinguish Z-Wave and ZigBee from each other.</p>

<h3>Frequency</h3>

<p>The first (as Eirik M noted) is the frequency on which they operate.  Z-Wave operates within the 915 MHz ISM band.  This gives it reasonable penetration of building materials (better than Wi-Fi) and good overall distance.  The fact that few other household devices use that band (now that 900 MHz cordless phones are less widespread) means there's also less interference.</p>

<p>ZigBee can operate at either 2.4 GHz or 915 MHz.<sup>1</sup>  2.4 GHz is a busy band; it's where Wi-Fi and microwave ovens (among other things) operate.  That means that 2.4 GHz ZigBee devices are subject to more interference than 915 MHz Z-Wave and ZigBee devices.  They also don't go through walls as readily.  (The 2.4 GHz band does give higher bit rates, which is why WiFi lives there (and also uses the 5 GHz band), but most IoT devices don't need to transfer lots of data quickly, so the lower bandwidth of the 915 MHz band isn't a drawback.)</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> 915 MHz is only used in North America.  Although 2.4 GHz is available worldwide, ZigBee's lower frequency band varies from one regulatory region to another.  The various bands are mostly in the 700 MHz to 900 MHz range, so the statements about the 915 MHz North American band are generally applicable to other regions, too.</p>

<h3>Openness</h3>

<p>ZigBee is an open standard, though you need to join the ZigBee alliance (for a fee), if you want to sell ZigBee devices.  Z-Wave is a licensed proprietary standard, although the high-level protocol is documented publicly.  If you want to make Z-Wave hardware, you have to license the specification from the Z-Wave Alliance and then have your device tested for compliance to the standard.  If you buy a Z-Wave device with an appropriately-programmable interface, you can use the already-licensed hardware with the public protocol specification to write your own software.</p>

<h3>Price</h3>

<p>Because of the lower barrier to entry, ZigBee devices can often be less expensive than Z-Wave devices with the same functionality.  Consumer IoT hardware can vary widely in price for many other reasons, of course.</p>

<h3>Interoperability</h3>

<p>Z-Wave devices tend to have better interoperability overall.  When new versions of the Z-Wave standard have been released, they've maintained backward compatibility; any Z-Wave device should be able to communicate sensibly with any other Z-Wave device, regardless of the age or manufacturer of each.  (Obviously, newer protocol features won't be present, but the older functionality will be preserved.)  Interoperability testing is part of the Z-Wave compliance process.  ZigBee doesn't have as rigorous a testing regimen, so it sometimes happens that two ZigBee devices that should be able to talk to each other cannot, due to implementation flaws in one or both devices.</p>

<p>On top of that, ZigBee supports a number of different <em>profiles</em> which all share the same underlying protocol but use different communication details.  (This is somewhat analogous to two different HTTP APIs; both use HTTP as a transport, but the Google Maps API isn't going to be very useful if you're talking to GitHub's servers.)  <em>Most</em> IoT ZigBee devices use the Home Automation profile, but that's not typically documented on the device, so you can run into unexpected problems.  As an example, Philips Hue lights use ZigBee, but do so in a deliberately inoperable way so you have to use the Philips Hue Bridge to control them.  (Contrast that with Z-Wave: the Z-Wave certification process requires that any Z-Wave light bulbs use the standard control classes and, thus, can be managed by any compliant Z-Wave controller.)</p>

<p>The ZigBee Alliance is currently in the process of developing a new iteration of the ZigBee protocol named ZigBee 3.0.  It looks like part of the new specification's goal will be to increase interoperability among ZigBee devices.  We'll have to see how that goes, though.  There doesn't seem to e a timetable for finalization of the new standard yet, though.</p>

<h3>Similarities</h3>

<p>As long as I've written the above, I figured I'd mention a few things that ZigBee and Z-Wave have in common that differentiate them from other protocols used for IoT devices.</p>

<p>ZigBee and Z-Wave are both mesh networks.  Unlike WiFi and Bluetooth, where every device needs to see the controller, Z* devices are okay as long as there's some communication path between them, other Z* devices in the same network, and the controller.  (Z-Wave devices will only mesh with Z-Wave devices, and ZigBee devices with a particular profile will only mesh with other ZigBee devices with that profile, of course.)</p>

<p>ZigBee and Z-Wave are both multi-vendor protocols.  Notwithstanding the stuff in the ""Openness"" section above, both ZigBee and Z-Wave have devices available from a variety of companies who often compete with each other.  (e.g. companies making Z-Wave light switches include GE, Aeotec, Linear, DragonTech, and others.)  Many other IoT-related protocols are single-company silos (e.g. Lutron Caséta); while they might have gateways that let other systems control them, only that company's devices can join the network.</p>

416,416,,,"<p>Although decentralised networks often look appealing as a solution, there are a few compelling advantages of centralised networks which make them far more popular at the minute.</p>

<h2>Design Overhead</h2>

<p>Understanding, programming and setting up a decentralised network is often much more challenging than a traditional centralised (client-server) model in the majority of cases. Take, for example, a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mesh network</a> (the topology used by ZigBee, Z-Wave and Thread), which tends to be structured like so:</p>

<p><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/NetworkTopology-Mesh.svg/592px-NetworkTopology-Mesh.svg.png"" alt=""Mesh network""></p>

<p>(image from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking#/media/File:NetworkTopology-Mesh.svg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>, in the public domain)</p>

<p>Nodes in the network must be capable of sending messages for themselves, but they must also be able to <strong>route messages across the network</strong>, which is more more complex, since each node must be able to calculate a route to the destination. The <a href=""https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/64/slides/6lowpan-3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IETF</a> has a rather interesting presentation on the routing protocols used in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6LoWPAN"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">6LoWPAN</a>, a mesh network protocol that uses IPv6. As you can see, the design is far more involved than a traditional star network connected to a Wi-Fi router, and of course each node will need more computational power to handle the additional processing steps needed to participate in the mesh network.</p>

<p>The main problem of all of this is that each node will require more processing power, and hence cost more. A <a href=""http://searchitchannel.techtarget.com/tip/Introduction-to-network-centralization-and-decentralization"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TechTarget article</a> addresses this more generally:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Centralization is an attempt to improve efficiency by taking advantage of potential economies of scale: improving the average; it may also improve reliability by minimizing opportunities for error. Decentralization is an attempt to improve speed and flexibility by reorganizing to increase local control and execution of a service: improving the best case. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The other side effect will be that the increased computation will lead to a higher power consumption (although this tradeoff may not be <em>that</em> significant compared to long-range transmissions which would otherwise be necessary).</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>Unless security is built-in to the design of the decentralised protocol, it can easily pose a big problem. Since nodes will be passing data between each other, it's difficult to guarantee the integrity of each packet, since one router node could easily replace one packet with another, and the receiver would never be able to tell the difference. A <a href=""http://smallbusiness.chron.com/security-issues-wireless-mesh-networks-46553.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chron article</a> describes this issue well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a computer becomes infected or malicious computer enters a mesh network, it can pretend to be a trusted member of that network and then modify sent data and disrupt how the network passes information. In a black hole attack, information passing through the infected computer will not continue through the network, blocking the flow of data. In gray hole attacks, some data may be blocked, while other data is allowed, making it seem like the computer is still a working part of the network. Wormhole attacks are harder to detect: They tunnel into a network computer from the outside and pretend to be other nodes in the network, essentially becoming invisible nodes. They can then monitor network traffic as it passes from one node to the next.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Economies of Scale</h2>

422,422,455.0,1.0,"<p>ANT/ANT+ is a proprietary but open access multicast wireless sensor network technology. It's data rate and the resulting application throughput of 20 to 60 kBit/s is significantly reduced compared to its competitors, i.e.  Bluetooth and ZigBee.

439,439,,,"<p>The <em>Internet of Everything</em> is primarily a marketing term <a href=""https://newsroom.cisco.com/ioe"" rel=""noreferrer"">used by Cisco</a>, in contrast to the <em>Internet of Things</em> which is a more generic term used by many groups and manufacturers. Since IoE is used almost exclusively by Cisco, their definition should be quite reliable:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Internet of Everything (IoE) brings together people, process, data, and things to make networked connections more relevant and valuable than ever before-turning information into actions that create new capabilities, richer experiences, and unprecedented economic opportunity for businesses, individuals, and countries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In practical terms, this boils down to a few key points, which I'll outline below.</p>

<h2>Machine to Machine (M2M) vs Machine to People (M2P)</h2>

<p>The Internet of Things is primarily associated with connecting <strong>machines</strong> and <strong>devices</strong> together so they can share data, e.g. connecting your light bulb to your smartphone so you can control it.</p>

<p>The Internet of <strong>Everything</strong> is a more holistic term that considers every step of the process: human interaction with the computer; the machine to machine interaction; the output to the human and the process in general.</p>

<p>IoE can be used in industry to describe the changes that come about as a consequence of interconnected devices, and talk about the new processes that factories can use to be more efficient.</p>

<h2>The Scale of the Internet of Everything</h2>

<p>The IoE can also encompass systems bigger than you traditionally find in IoT networks. One example on the Cisco website is a train network, which is far bigger than you'd find in a domestic IoT network (the train could have a whole IoT network of its own, then be connected to a <strong>bigger</strong> network!).</p>

<p>Overall, there isn't a lot of difference - it's just a marketing buzzword used by Cisco, but it's otherwise very similar to the term <em>Internet of Things</em>.</p>

  <p>connecting the unconnected  — people-to-people (P2P),
  machine-to-people (M2P), and machine-to-machine  (M2M) — via the

<p>So basically it seems to be a broader term, the next generation of IoT <a href=""http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/ac79/docs/innov/IoE_Economy.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">according to Cisco</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The point is that all devices will have direct connection to the Internet</strong>, while in IoT the devices are members of an Internet-Like-Network but not necessarily the Internet itself.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/ac79/docs/innov/IoE_Economy.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">What makes it possible</a> is the IPv6 which will allow countless devices to have its own IP address.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Second, barriers to connectedness continue to drop. For example, IPv6
  overcomes  the  IPv4   limit   by  allowing  for 
  <strong>340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456</strong>  more     people,
  processes, data, and things to be connected to the Internet.
  Amazingly, IPv6  creates enough address capacity for every star in the
  known universe to have 4.8  trillion addresses.</p>

<p>So IoE emphasizes TCP/IP connection and larger, more comprehensive networks.</p>

<p>But all in all there are not much differences at all. Using only TCP/IP in IoE exclude a lot of IoT platforms and devices but the concept does not change much.</p>

441,441,,,"<p>The technical answer to <em>is this security unbreakable?</em> is ""no"".  The primary reason is that biometric attributes are not secrets.  Some are easily duplicated, like <a href=""http://cryptome.info/0001/gummy/gummy.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fingerprints</a>, or <a href=""http://biometrics.cse.msu.edu/Publications/Face/WenHanJain_FaceSpoofDetection_TIFS15.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">images of faces</a>.  Some are harder to spoof, like <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/07/red-flag-biometrics-iris-scanner-vulnerability-revealed"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">irises</a>.  But once a biometric attribute is captured, it can be replayed. And biometric attributes are fixed.  If a user's attribute is ever copied, you obviously can't tell the user ""we've had a breach, change your iris.""</p>

<p>It is highly unlikely that an average thief will be able to spoof all of the biometric sensors simultaneously.  However, it would not be impossible for a dedicated, sophisticated attacker to engineer such a feat.</p>

<p>In addition to sensor spoofing, it may be possible to perform a replay attack using the data emitted by the sensors.  However, this would be implementation dependent, and one would expect a company to architect the security of their devices against this type of attack.  </p>

<p>This is where the IoT approach might provide worse security than an integrated solution.  If the sensors are unrelated to each other, an attacker could compromise one device at a time without raising suspicion.  The attacker can practice with a fake gummi-bear fingerprint until he gets that perfected, then he use that fake fingerprint while he practices with a photo to fool the image sensor.  An integrated sensor could be architected to require all attributes to be present at the same time; the IoT approach could be implemented in a piecemeal fashion, with vulnerabilities created by the gaps between the systems.</p>

<p>Practically, this approach still sounds very secure, and would be better security than a simple passcode or a single biometric measurement.  </p>

458,458,,,"<p>The <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6lowpan-hc-15#section-3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC draft</a> explains a bit better how the header compression works. What is described as <em>arbitrary prefixes</em> in the abstract is essentially a bunch of information that is assumed to be in a certain range or having a specific value. Thus, making transmitting those information unnecessary.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To enable effective compression LOWPAN_IPHC relies on information pertaining to the entire 6LoWPAN.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This assumption goes for the <em>entire 6LoWPAN</em>, breaking down the next sentence we have six information that are assumed to be known or in a considerably smaller range of values. </p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Version is 6; </li>
  <li>Traffic Class and Flow Label are both zero; </li>
  <li>Payload Length can be inferred from lower layers from either
  the 6LoWPAN Fragmentation header or the IEEE 802.15.4 header; </li>
  <li>Hop Limit will be set to a well-known value by the source; </li>
  <li>addresses assigned to 6LoWPAN interfaces will be formed using the link-local
  prefix or a small set of routable prefixes assigned to the entire
  6LoWPAN; </li>
  <li>addresses assigned to 6LoWPAN interfaces are formed with an
  IID derived directly from either the 64-bit extended or 16-bit short
  IEEE 802.15.4 addresses.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>(Bullet points by me, otherwise continuing section three of the draft.)</p>

<p>This also explains why this compression is not used by devices like your PC. Your PC has to be able to address the whole world basically. However the compression as described above is only really effective if used in a sufficiently constrained environment—the <em>entire 6LoWPAN</em>—and not the world.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the best case, the LOWPAN_IPHC can compress the IPv6 header down to two octets (the dispatch octet and the LOWPAN_IPHC encoding) with link-local communication.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Still same draft section)</p>

<p>As described in the RFC draft the compression gets even better when it's in a more constricted environment. For <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-local_address"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link local</a> only it's down to two octets. Of course, we want our usual computers and end devices to be able to address everything else instead. However, if we want to be able to change all those values this compression takes as granted it doesn't work anymore. We'd have a mismatch between what we mean and what every other network participant thinks we mean, because the compression takes values for granted.</p>

<li>3g v Wifi Security</li>

<li>If I'm worried about a device that could send some personal information without my consent is unplugging it and returning it to the store the only solution.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>3g v Wifi Security</strong></p>

<p>It is possible to sniff 3G signals, <a href=""http://security.stackexchange.com/q/10416/134573"">e.g.</a> , however of more concern might be ensuring the packets cannot be decrypted on the cloud receiver end, where they can be easily wiresharked.  In order to avoid this a good device encryption level protocol could be used.</p>

<p>On the WiFi side, yes you can sniff more easily but again if the message is encrypted, it doesn't matter.</p>

<p>The AWS platform offers really strong security
<a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/x509-certs.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/x509-certs.html</a></p>

<p>AWS IoT supports the following certificate-signing algorithms:</p>

<pre><code>[SHA256WITHRSA][1]
SHA384WITHRSA
SHA384WITHRSA
SHA512WITHRSA
RSASSAPSS
DSA_WITH_SHA256
ECDSA-WITH-SHA256
ECDSA-WITH-SHA384
ECDSA-WITH-SHA512
</code></pre>

<p>So using this security stack your data cannot be brute force sniffed at source as it would currently take billions of years.  I am familiar with AWS but assume azure has a similar offering which of course you could implement separately.</p>

<p>In summary, the transport protocol does not matter.  Take your security pick, (3G or wifi).  If implemented properly both are secure assuming the hackers are not microscopically x-raying and modelling the silicon of your IoT device.  Perhaps if you see someone in your house with a star trek type X-Ray machine it is time to worry?</p>

<p><strong>Standard wifi v LoRaWan/LPWAN</strong></p>

<p>Let's rate against SHA256withRSA</p>

<p><em>LoRaWan</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each device is provisioned with a unique AES 128 <a href=""http://portal.lora-alliance.org/DesktopModules/Inventures_Document/FileDownload.aspx?ContentID=1085"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">key</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>To my knowledge AES 128 is un-crackable.</p>

<p><em>LPWAN</em></p>

<p>LPWAN is not a <a href=""http://kadenzsearch.com/comparing-lpwan-technologies-for-the-internet-of-things/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">standard</a>.  It includes:</p>

<p>LoRa / SigFox/ WAVIoT NB-Fi.  So you need to evaluate the security of each protocol falling under LPWAN.  As we have seen LoRa is pretty secure.</p>

<p><strong>If I'm worried..</strong></p>

<p>I would suggest talk to the manufacturer first, see what data they collect, maybe it is harmless?  If you are still suspicious and don't believe them and don't have access to the source code, then maybe it is time to return it.</p>

  <p>Self Test helps ensure that your Nest Protect is working to keep you safe, and gives you essential information when you need it, so it can't be disabled. </p>

<p>The Nightly Promise automatically shows as soon as you dim the lights at night - no button is required for it to display.</p>

487,487,513.0,1.0,"<p>Many manufacturers of 'smart lighting' systems claim that connecting your lights to the Internet of Things will save energy.

488,488,,,"<p>That's an <em>awesome</em> question!</p>

<p>The influence of IoT in power saving wouldn't be that huge, as you've mentioned.</p>

<p>But making them smart enough would save a lot of energy.</p>

<p>The radio system and the whole automation system would consume only about 5 V @ 1 A (max) if there are no motor drivers and other power components involved (in the case of lights, there are no actuators!). </p>

<p>The consumption of a bulb will be quite large (in fact multiples) compared to that of the IoT system.</p>

<p>So, if the bulb is on for another 5 minutes without being noticed, it would consume quite high amount of power than the IoT device may consume day long!</p>

<p>Connecting multiple devices together can still increase the efficiency because the system could be used to check whether the person is inside using motion sensors, or sensing the door. Which can actually malfunction. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>eg: if the person is inside and idle, the light goes off (Guy gets
  annoyed). or if the guy is out and the door is open and there is some
  moving object in the room, the bulb still glows!(Lot of energy gone)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the device is connected too internet, the Guy's phone would have the necessary app, when he goes out of the house, the phone knows he's out and the whole home will be off (configurable). </p>

<p>I have very little idea about the particular products you are talking about because I have not used either of them myself!</p>

Far more than the power consumption, it is customizable and that's what makes it stand out!</p>

500,500,,,"<p>Currently, Alexa supports <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201971890"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>very limited</em> customisation</a> of the wake word:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Currently, you can use these wake words:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Alexa</li>
  <li>Echo</li>
  <li>Amazon</li>
  <li>Computer</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The documentation also provides instructions for how to select the wake word:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Open the Alexa app.</li>
  <li>Open the left navigation panel and then select Settings.</li>
  <li>Select your device from the menu.</li>
  <li>Scroll down and select Wake Word.</li>
  <li>Use the drop-down menu to select a wake word and then select Save. When you change the wake word, the light ring on your device flashes orange briefly.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>This is supported for any Alexa device activated by the wake word, and can be highly useful in situations where you are in range of multiple Echos. For example, if your kitchen and bedroom are close, your bedroom Echo might be activated when you intended to activate your kitchen device. By changing the wake word for one of these devices, you can avoid this problem.</p>

<p>However, as I implied at the start of my answer, you can't choose <em>any wake word you like</em>; an <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/10/05/google_why_cant_we_choose_wake_words/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article by The Register</a> suggests why:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And here's where you get to the nuts and bolts of it: choosing a wake word is a little bit of an art: it needs to be short, but a minimum of three syllables; it needs to be easy to say; it needs to have a fairly consistent pronunciation across all different types of people; and it needs to be uncommonly used.</p>
  
  <p>You need at least three syllables so the software can catch on that you're explicitly speaking to it and that it's not just picking up the start of an unrelated word or random noise. Imagine if you made the wake-up word ""Tom"" and said ""tomato"" next to your gadget – you may confuse the heck out of it.</p>
  
  <p>Giving consumers the ability to choose their own wake words is a potentially huge headache.

  <p>Is there a simple practical way of adding Parental Control to Echo Dot?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the moment, the answer is <strong>no, not really</strong>. This <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/390u8h/parental_controls/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reddit discussion</a> seems to suggest that there is no method of parental controls whatsoever:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Are there any sort of parental controls available for the Echo?] Nope. They said that something about a family mode coming in the future that would also allow us to take it further the other way - unbleeped cussing. I'm bothered my phone Siri and Google Now can cuss and my home A.I. can't.</p>
  
  <p>I suggest asking them for this through feedback - maybe suggesting they allow us to customize it so it either bleeps swears AND limits explicit content or is a free-for-all so families and single adults can have different settings...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, there are some ways you can protect children, depending on your cause of concern.</p>

<h2>Profanity</h2>

<p>A <a href=""http://www.geekwire.com/2015/bleeping-awesome-amazon-echos-alexa-will-now-cuss-command/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GeekWire article</a> discusses how Alexa will self-censor any swearing, especially in titles of music, videos and other media:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, Alexa actually will bleep out part of a word that she is too modest to repeat. That may be the first mark of true artificial intelligence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alexa will even <a href=""https://www.cnet.com/uk/how-to/things-alexa-cant-do-yet/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">refuse to repeat swearing if you use the 'Simon says' command</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you use the ""Simon says"" command, Alexa will repeat anything you say. Even if you speak a number of expletives, Alexa will repeat your words, only the swearing will be bleeped out. Some people might wish she did otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Unwanted Purchases</h2>

<p>Since your Echo will be linked to an Amazon account, you may wish to <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201952610"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">disable voice purchasing</a> to avoid children from unexpectedly buying things and leaving you a hefty bill to pay. Through the Alexa app, you can disable voice purchasing trivially easily.</p>

<h2>Manners</h2>

<p>This may seem a rather odd point, but <a href=""http://qz.com/701521/parents-are-worried-the-amazon-echo-is-conditioning-their-kids-to-be-rude/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">some people object to the fact that Alexa will not encourage you to say 'please' and 'thank you'</a>. It seems rather unusual to worry about this in my opinion, but some people are concerned that since Alexa will respond even if you rudely command it, young children will start to believe that it is acceptable to just order people around.</p>

<p>There is no software solution to this - you will simply have to encourage your children to <em>be nice</em>!</p>

<p>Overall, although there aren't any built-in parental controls, you should be relatively safe to use it around your children, provided that you take the precautions before letting your children use the device. Amazon <em>know</em> that many people have purchased an Echo specifically for their children, so it seems likely that they'll continue to enforce some protections such as the profanity filter.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can a skill set be developed/made available to implement Parental Control?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not without great difficulty.

519,519,,,"<p>I'll make an attempt at answering this, but want to clarify that this is my inference, not an expert's view.</p>

<p>A ""fog node"" is potentially anything between a smart endpoint (for example a security camera with image recognition), and an enhanced router node located potentially at a GSM cell-site.</p>

<p>For a node to qualify as a fog node, it needs to perform some of the functions that might be performed at a server under a different architecture. So, in the Alexa model, audio <em>could</em> be streamed continuously to a server in the cloud, or <em>all</em> of the audio processing (not just the hot-word detection) can be performed at the node.</p>

<p>The important distinction of a fog node seems to be that the upstream bandwidth is reduced compared with the local bandwidth, so it is likely that audio or image processing is being performed.</p>

<p>Based on this definition, I think even an intelligent protocol bridge is not quite a fog-node (but the hardware which is used may well be capable of performing fog-node functions) - thinking of my lightwave-rf WiFi link...</p>

520,520,,,"<p>What it looks like they're trying to do is establish semantic definitions for messages and rules that can be interpreted or processed at any layer, and that the layers can be migrated up or down.  So yes, a home hub could be a fog node, but only if it supports the fog behaviors and messages.</p>

<p>Think of a typical home automation architecture:</p>

<pre><code>Remote -&lt;Z-wave&gt;- light switch -&lt;Z-wave&gt;- home hub -&lt;Ethernet&gt;- cloud server -&lt;GSM&gt;- phone
</code></pre>

<p>You trigger the remote and it sends a Z-wave message to the switch, which turns on the light.  You can configure your home hub to send a message to the switch based on other rules (the garage door is opened.)  And your watch can talk to your phone which can contact the company's cloud, which sends the message to your home hub, which sends it to your light switch.</p>

<p>Today, you can do the first part of this by setting up a scene in your light switch that is triggered by a paired remote.  Using Z-wave, no home hub is needed.  You can add a home hub and set up a new scene to trigger the light switch if the remote's button is pressed, but you better delete the scene in the light switch first.  You can use a cloud interface to configure your hub's behavior, perhaps triggering your hub via IFTTT.  And you can also use your phone to contact a web interface on the cloud and have it turn on the switch.</p>

<p>What OpenFog is aiming to do is to have those device definitions be universal, the rules be platform independent, and the messages be transport independent.  They'll share common security and authentication methods.  That means you set it up once, no matter where you are, and the definitions and rules are migrated up and down the architecture.  </p>

<p>From your phone you could view your devices, which would include the light switch and remote control, and say ""I want button 1 on the remote to toggle the light switch"".  The rules might be created right there in your phone, then transported to the cloud server.  The cloud server could examine the inputs and decide ""All the responsibility for lights and remotes belongs at a lower level"", and push the rules down to the home hub.  The home hub could say ""hey, Z-wave knows how to run a scene in this model of light switch, so I will push these rules to the light switch and remote.""  Next time you push the button on the remote, the signal will be caught by the light switch and the light will turn on.  This would provide the fastest possible response time (no hub needed).  And by having the rules backed up at a cloud level, if you have to replace a defective light switch, none of the rules need to change.  They'd just be pushed back down to the replacement switch.</p>

<p>OpenFog also will provide for elastic scale.  Let's say you place 1000 light switches in an office building, using a network technology that has a latency that goes up exponentially based on the number of nodes.  It could scale communications such that the 1000 nodes are split into 10 networks, so that no network ever has a latency longer than 200 milliseconds.  </p>

<p>It also specifies scalability of control.  If you've ever worked with systems built for GUI control you get used to instructions like these: ""right click on the node, pick 'settings', then set intensity to '75%', then 'OK'"".  Such instructions are worse than useless when it comes to managing 60,000 nodes.  OpenFog should enable automated groupings of nodes allowing scalable control.  ""For all nodes in Eastern Standard Time zone, set intensity to 75%,"" or ""For all nodes in profit center 12, set intensity to 65%.""</p>

<p>It also specifies autonomy where possible.  If the Peoria, Illinois branch replaces a furnace vent duct control, it shouldn't require an HQ person to delete the old control unit ID, then add the replacement ID.  The local maintenance person should be able to do that herself.  The security still has to ensure that the furnace repair person doesn't have the authority to disable the burglar alarm sensors on the back door.  </p>

<p>Now, place all of this behind open standards so that a Honeywell burglar alarm and a Trane heating system all interoperate in the same logical network as your Philips light bulbs, Leviton Z-wave switches, and your Fitbit scale.</p>

<p>So, is your SmartThings hub an OpenFog node?  Not today, and it won't be unless and until it implements and interoperates with these standards.  But a future home hub certainly could be an OpenFog node.</p>

525,525,,,"<p>There is no single definitive set of parameters which you can use to select an integrated device like this, but I think as a first approximation, newly designed devices might be significantly better than something from a couple of years ago.

<p>Pay close attention to the power states which are offered, viewed from the perspective of your whole system (regulators, oscilators, sensor signal conditioning). It is possible (unlikely) that your 2 min active state will benefit from a less deep sleep than the normal operating state.</p>

<p>The lowest power useful state <em>should</em> account for the majority of your energy consumption. Exactly how this pans out for you depends on things like if you can operate directly off power without a regulator, minimum operating voltage, etc.</p>

<p>For the active state, consider your most RAM or compute intensive operations and benchmark them using the nearest equivalent off-the-shelf parts you can find (based on CPU, speed and memory architecture).

528,528,,,"<p>There's no magic bullet, so I think the advice will be painfully obvious.  Start chipping away at the biggest power consumers first. </p>

<p>Reevaluate the protocol. Every byte you shave represents a savings of 1% of your current RF power budget. Sending any Boolean values? Use bit flags, not an ASCII 'Y' or 'N'. Make sure you're using the smallest possible container - don't transmit a 16-bit integer if the number has a permissible range of only 0-99. Most battery powered protocols try to squeeze it down as far as possible; e.g. if you're reporting on a 5x5 array of elements, the address only needs to be a 5-bit field, not an 8-bit byte. Using CPU cycles for compression-related logic results in a much lower overall power draw than transmitting unneeded bits.</p>

530,530,,,"<p>Absolutely, because:</p>

<ol>
<li>A secure device and channel means that you can <strong>trust the data</strong>. Yes, the actual temperature is not very private, but an attacker can provide false temperatures and cause an undesirable response (e.g turning heating on unneccesarily). This is how stuxnet worked, by misreporting the speed of the centrifuges, causing the control system to make them go faster until they broke. Note that a secure channel is not only encrypted, but <strong>authenticated</strong> and <strong>integrity-protected</strong>. Integrity is what matters here.<br>
Encryption alone does not let you trust the data: an attacker can modify encrypted data even if they don't know exactly what they're modifying. Even authentication alone does not let you fully trust the data, as authentic data can be replayed. You need a protocol that guarantees data integrity.</li>
<li>It's difficult to tell the difference between a faulty device and a compromised device. Detection and repair of faults is difficult and costly, so not having to repair devices (or debug the entire system) is worth putting in some security.</li>
<li>Within a broader ecosystem you don't want some devices with encryption and some not, as this increases costs, maintenance, and management of devices. If you cannot say, for certain, that no private data will be transmitted in a few years' time on the system (not just the device), then it may be safer to engineer it now.</li>
<li>Your definition of private data may be wrong, and unless you're checking it with auditors and regulatory experts across the regions in which you operate, assume that the data is private. GPS co-ordinates, and even IP addresses can be considered personally identifiable by some regulatory frameworks. </li>

542,542,,1.0,"<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>KNX is a standardized, OSI-based network communications protocol for building automation. It is the successor to, and convergence of, 3 previous standards: EHS, BatiBUS and EIB.</p>

<p>KNX is currently the de facto standard in building automation in Europe. The KNX Association had 339 members/manufacturers from 37 countries. The KNX Association has partnership agreements with more than 30,000 installer companies in 100 countries and more than 60 technical universities as well as over 150 training centres. Member companies have more than 7000 KNX certified product in their catalogues.</p>

<p>Until recently, KNX did not have support for support for TCP. While there has been <a href=""http://www.knx.org/fileadmin/template/documents/downloads_support_menu/KNX_tutor_seminar_page/tutor_documentation/08_IP%20Communication_E0510a.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an IP based implementation of KNX named KNXNet</a> for quite a while now, this protocol uses UDP as the transport layer, which is not very programmer-friendly and rather poorly supported in comparison with TCP.</p>

<p>Only recently did the KNX Association release <a href=""https://www.knx.org/media/docs/Flyers/KNX-IoT/KNX-IoT_en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a KNX Standard extension for KNX web services</a>. This means that there is now an official standard for implementing RESTful web services, which makes it far easier to integrate the KNX eco-system with other technology:</p>

<p>The KNX WS specification foresees three flavors to ease the integration with an existing ecosystem: oBIX, BACnet/WS and OPC/UA. </p>

<h3>The actual question</h3>

<p>I'm currently having a basic KNX home automation installed in my home by a certified installer. I would like to purchase such a gateway to implement a custom web + mobile UI for my home, but I've been informed by both my installer and the KNX Association that no commercial solutions are on the market that support the new web services extention out of the box... yet <em>(*)</em>. Neither seems to have any idea whatsoever when such a gateway might become available on the market.</p>

<p>So...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Does anyone here know if any major brands are working on such a gateway and when the first gateways of this kind are expected to be released?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there currently conventional KNX/IP gateways out there that can be extended with KNX WS at the software level, so I don't need any additional hardware (like a NAS or a Raspberry Pi) to extend them with KNX WS support?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, this kind of information is very, very hard to find anywhere online.</p>

543,543,572.0,4.0,"<p>IoT enabled light bulbs have been on the market for a while now.  The Philips Hue is probably the best known.  But I think controlling bulbs directly is a rule-maintenance disaster waiting to happen.  If a bulb goes out (and yes, LED bulbs do fail), you have to replace the bulb, and remember to update any scenes or other rules that control the bulb (or are triggered by the bulb.)  Or if you move a bulb from fixture A in the kitchen to fixture B in the bedroom, (perhaps while cleaning), the rule that says ""Turn on kitchen lights"" will now illuminate the bedroom.</p>

<p>That may not seem like a big problem today for those of us who understand the configurations of our home automation systems intimately, but imagine a home automation system set up by a professional integrator for a typical customer.  The homeowner may not know how to change the rules, so replacing a lightbulb could cost them not only the price of the smart bulb, but an additional service call charge from the integration company.  A smart switch or fixture solves this problem because the switch doesn't move with typical maintenance.  (The switch offers the same problem of configuration if it fails and needs to be replaced, of course, but switches typically have better life expectancies than bulbs, which are generally considered consumables.)</p>

<p>On the other hand, an IoT enabled light switch can't fully control every aspect of lighting the same way a smart light bulb can.  A switch can do simple dimming for certain technologies of bulbs, but it can't control the color of the Hue bulb.  </p>

<p>Much worse, smart switches use different types of electronic circuitry to perform dimming, and must be carefully matched to the technology of the bulbs they are controlling.  A typical older dimmer can dim only incandescent bulbs and not CFL or LED bulbs; some dimmers can dim both incandescent and CFL but not LED bulbs; some dimmers can control incandescent bulbs and LED bulbs, but not CFLs; and some dimmers can control inductive loads like halogen transformers, but not CFLs or LEDs!  With incandescent bulbs being replaced because they're such energy wasters, this has been a real problem, too.</p>

<p>So what's the most practical approach?  Buy expensive bulbs that are directly controllable and expensive smart switches to control them, or buy cheap bulbs and just expensive smart switches, and give up on the idea of controllable color lighting? </p>

547,547,,,"<p>There are a few aspects to consider, and the answer will depend a lot on your exact situation.</p>

<h2>Customisation</h2>

<p>Smart switches will allow far more choice in lighting overall, since you can use any bulb that would work normally. As noted in <a href=""https://www.cnet.com/uk/news/smart-bulbs-vs-smart-switches-the-pros-and-cons-of-connected-lighting/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this CNet article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With a smart switch, you're free to use whatever bulb you want -- perfect if you're picky about light quality, or if your fixture requires bulbs of a particular size, shape, or style that's incompatible with smart bulbs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the customisation issue goes the other way too. With a 'smart bulb' such as the Philips Hue, you gain the ability to change the bulb colour as well as the brightness and on/off state. With a smart switch, I would imagine that colour changing is impractical, because the switch is 'dumb' and doesn't know what's connected to it, just like your regular light switch.</p>

<h2>Installation/Setup</h2>

<p>This is another issue with advantages and disadvantages for both options. A smart switch will need to be wired in to the lighting circuit to control your lights, which is nowhere near as straightforward as simply plugging in a bulb, as with most smart bulbs. Of course, if the bulb doesn't fit in the first place, you're going to have a problem using the smart bulb, but <em>most</em> light fixtures use standard sizes.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a smart bulb is likely to need more setup, and some require a hub as well, which adds to the setup time and complexity. The majority of smart switches on the market seem to connect via Wi-Fi, and hence do not require an additional hub.</p>

<h2>Cost</h2>

<p>This is a far more difficult issue to quantify, since there is such a diverse range of products on the market. I've just picked some relatively popular products for the example, and this will vary widely depending on the exact products chosen.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B01KJYSO68"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Philips Hue starter kit</a>, which provides three bulbs and a hub, costs $199.99.</p>

<p>To compare, the <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00DGEGJ02"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WeMo Light Switch</a> is $47.94 (each), so $143.82 for 3 switches. However, you do <strong>not</strong> get the dimming and colour changing options with this, so it may be worth deciding whether those functions are worth the additional $56.17.</p>

<h2>'Graceful degradation'</h2>

<p>Many smart bulbs will simply stop working altogether if you turn the proper light switch off, because they require power to operate, so they can't respond to wireless control. A smart switch won't have this problem - it's always connected to power and ready to respond - so it will be far more intuitive to the users of your system to use smart switches.</p>

<p>I also heard a highly useful rule of thumb when designing a smart home - it should be simple enough that both a 5-year-old and and 80-year-old can understand it without needing to be taught. In the case of a smart switch, you'll have no problems - it works just like any other switch, and toggling it will toggle the light, whether physically or wirelessly. A smart bulb might fail this test - switching it off physically then on wirelessly <strong>doesn't work</strong>, which is likely to confuse anyone who finds this problem.</p>

<p>The rule of thumb I mentioned is helpful to ensure that your IoT architecture doesn't get so complex that you can't operate it normally. In other words, if you can't operate your lights like you could before, <strong>you're doing it wrong!</strong></p>

<p>In summary, think about these points and decide which is best for you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you <strong>need</strong> dimming and colour changing? If so, pick a <strong>smart bulb</strong>.</li>
<li>Are you able to wire up a smart switch electrically, and want the choice of any 'dumb' bulb to use in your lights? If this is the case, <strong>pick a smart switch</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Above all, I'd suggest <strong>not</strong> mixing the two systems together - this way, the user of the home can learn how the system works and all their lights will work the same way - mixing two systems will lead to more confusion for little gain.</p>

554,554,,1.0,"<p>I am stuck with a peculiar situation at home, and would appreciate any help. </p>

<p>I have: </p>

<ul>
<li>Marantz NR1504 AV receiver, connected via PowerLan and Ethernet to the router/modem.</li>
<li>Samsung SmartTV, connected via WiFi to the same router.</li>
<li>Android smartphones, with BubbleUPnP, connected via WiFi to the same router.</li>
<li>Synology DS414 connected via Ethernet directly to the same router.</li>
</ul>

<p>Synology carries a collection of musical files, MP3 and FLAC. I could access this collection from the TV, the receiver and BubbleUPnP. I could play them directly from the receiver, play them using the TV using HDMI-returned sound, or use my smartphone to access the musical collection and play the sound with the receiver. </p>

<p>Synology serves the musical files using Media Server. </p>

<p>To summarise, the situation was like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>BubbpleUPnP could see the musical collection on Synology and could see the receiver.</li>
<li>Receiver could see the musical collection on Synology and could see the BubbleUPnP.</li>
<li>TV could see the musical collection on Synology.</li>
</ul>

<p>Everything worked fine, until some moment. I didn't use all features all the time, so I don't know when exactly things went wrong. However currently the situation is like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>BubbleUPnP does not see Synology at all; it still sees the receiver.</li>
<li>Receiver does not see Synology at all. It does see BubbleUPnP.</li>
<li>TV can see Synology just fine, with all media files.</li>
<li>Synology's Media Server shows TV, BubbleUPnP and receiver in Media Server > DMA Compatibility > Device List. </li>
</ul>

<p>So: </p>

<ul>
<li>Two DLNA channels work just fine: TV—Synology and BubbleUPnP—receiver.</li>
<li>Two DLNA channels work one way: Synology sees BubbleUPnP and receiver, but not the other way round.</li>
</ul>

<p>I wonder if there is a ""standard"" or recommended approach to debugging such configuration.

556,556,,,"<p>These problems are always tricky to figure out. The approach I take is to first document each network interface on each device, including routers, access points, and POWERlan adapters. Record the MAC address, IP address, default gateway, netmask, and hostname. </p>

<p>Now, go to your main DHCP server (probably in your home router) and make sure its logs show the exact same MAC addresses you recorded, and that each MAC was issued the exact same IP addresses you saw. A difference may mean you've accidentally enabled a second DHCP server (perhaps hidden in a cheap access point, WiFi range extender, or POWERlan adapter) which could be creating false network settings in some of your devices, slicing your network in two. </p>

<p>Make sure all your devices are in the same subnet. That means they all have the same netmask, and the topmost bits are all the same as each other. For example, if your router's netmask is 255.255.255.0, then all your devices should have their top 3 octets in common with the default gateway and each other, such as 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2, and 192.168.1.3</p>

<p>In a small home network such as you've described, I'd expect all devices to share a common default gateway. Make sure it's the internal network facing IP address of your router.</p>

<p>If you think it may be a rogue DHCP problem but just can't figure out what's going on, consider converting all your network interfaces to use static IP addresses.</p>

560,560,,0.0,"<p>I have a 3-speed ceiling fan with integrated dimmable lights which when installed prior to my owning the house was fitted with an infrared wireless receiver.</p>

<p>For a long time the remote did not work (poor quality construction) and after repairing it and having a few months of use have since found the receiver now isn't working (I've tried all the jumper combinations).</p>

<p>so I now seek to replace the wireless  receiver with one that supports a home automation system rather than just another infrared like-for-like replacement. My existing remote control looks like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oAFrG.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oAFrG.jpg"" alt=""Infra-red remote control""></a></p>

<p>Has anyone come across a home-automation system with wireless receiver (ideally compatible with at least one of the major brand solutions such as Z-wave, ZigBee, LightwaveRF, Smartwares etc, but honestly I'd consider anything) for a <strong>3-speed ceiling fan</strong> with integrated dimmable lights? </p>

<p>I've seen an <a href=""http://www.insteon.com/ceiling-fan-controller/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Insteon Ceiling Fan and Light Controller</a> module available for U.S. ceiling fans running on 120V AC but they don't seem to have a product for 240V AC as required for UK models.</p>

<p>I've also seen a <a href=""http://qubino.com/products/flush-dimmer/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Qubino Flush Dimmer</a> which could control the dimmable lights and their website says a second unit of the same would also be suitable for controlling the fan but I'm not certain of this aspect since it is a 3-speed fan (i.e. off, slow, medium, fast), not just variable speed (I can't set it to 62% speed for example). </p>

<p>What I don't know however is whether this 3-speed setup is a limitation of the current wireless infra-red receiver/controller or of the fan unit itself, and this is where I find myself a bit out of my depth. The ceiling fan unit looks similar to this, except with no pull-cords for operation:</p>

<p><strong>Scenario</strong></p>

<p>I installed the <a href=""https://github.com/bwssytems/ha-bridge"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>ha bridge</em></a> github project on my Raspberry Pi, mainly to see what it can do. I literally just followed the first few steps, downloading and starting the <em>habridge</em>. To my great surprise my Logitech Harmony Hub seems to freely share all his information with the new bridge. <strong><em>I have not entered any credentials whatsoever.</em></strong> The only thing I provided was the Harmony's IP address and a bogus device name (i.e. my hub has actually another display name for all Logitech and Alexa purposes).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rgrR8.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rgrR8.png"" alt=""EveryonePushButtons""></a></p>

<p>I have looked in both the desktop program as well as the mobile app. Neither seems to offer any way to activate any security options.</p>

<p>When I look into the log of the <em>habridge</em> it even shows that the Harmony apparently broadcasts everything that happens. The activities that can be seen there (minus cropped ID) were triggered by the Harmony App. There's also a heartbeat that tells my <em>habridge</em> immediately when the Hub is offline.</p>

573,573,,,"<p>There are several differences between the Norton Core and a normal router.</p>

<p><strong>1. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Deep Packet inspection</a>.</strong>  From <a href=""http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/norton-core-secure-router-for-smart-home-devices"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TrustedReviews.com</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Core is a combination of Symantec's pre-existing security knowhow and some new features we’ve not seen before. The router will inspect every packet of data that passes through it for known pieces of malware and other naughties. This is a common feature in business networking products but is seldom found in kit for use in the home.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, it's a kind of firewall which is right on the entrypoint to your home, so it filters all traffic going to and from your home.  Therefore, even if an individual computer's security is compromised, there is a second line of defence.  As @jpmc26 mentioned in the comments below, it is certainly not a fail-proof security wall: malicious hackers can take other routes.  However, it helps tighten up the security on your network <em>in case</em> the security on an individual device is compromised temporarily.</p>

574,574,,,"<p>I'm pleased to see that this product exists, and hope that other vendors of routers follow suit.</p>

<p>The solution to recent consumer IoT security problems lies in the intelligence of the home network that is wrapped in the router. We will never get cheap-as-possible manufacturers to implement some yet-to-be-defined security protocol. And, as much as we try and educate consumers, people will buy on price, not security (which may be too complex for them to understand).</p>

<p>It's easy to solve the problem at the network level. Less trustworthy devices can be put on a separate network, where leaking of wifi passwords causes less of a problem, devices can be firewalled, and traffic can be monitored. Although this could, in theory, be done with existing routers, it requires a level of networking skill, and interest/desire to maintain the network, that does not exist with most consumers.</p>

<p>The solution is better UIs so that consumers can interact with routers in a way that hides complexity, and more 'intelligence', possibly packaged as 'home networking as a service'. The Norton Core seems to be doing (at least) these two things, and as a result goes a long way to improving home network security, which in turn reduces the risk of rogue IoT devices.</p>

<p>So while people with networking skills and interests may find better products to solve their problems, for the average consumer, the Norton Core seems to be a move in the right direction.</p>

575,575,,3.0,"<p>What IoT services are available for storing/sending/publishing (and opposite operations) generic small amount of data in the cloud?</p>

<p>I am looking, for example, for a service where a device could store a value  in the cloud. And some other entity (another device, a website with some JS code, a web server, a mobile app) could retrieve this value.</p>

<p>It could be some kind of asynchronous communication, for example for storing and retrieving something as small as a key&amp;value pair, &lt;255bytes, an integer, a string, at most a small JSON object. The service could offer a REST API (so it could be accessed by a large variety of languages) with some token to authenticate and the key &amp; value to store.</p>

<p>A detailed example of a use case is: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a temperature sensor at home, and I want it to store the
  value in the cloud(<em>somewhere out of home</em>). In such way, I could access it, regardless of my
  home connection is down or not. Morevoer, this would avoid keeping and
  maintaining a dedicated server + portForwarding + DynamicDNS.</p>

580,580,,,"<p>The Coke Machine, rather amusingly, <a href=""https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~coke/"">has its own website</a> with a bit more information on its history.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~coke/history_long.txt""><em>Ancient History</em></a> document explains how the original Coke Machine operated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The final piece of the puzzle was needed to let people check Coke
  status when they were logged in on some other machine than CMUA. CMUA's
  Finger server was modified to run the Coke status program whenever
  someone fingered the nonexistent user ""coke"". (For the uninitiated,
  Finger normally reports whether a specified user is logged in, and if
  so where.) Since Finger requests are part of standard ARPANET (now
  Internet) protocols, people could check the Coke machine from any CMU
  computer by saying ""finger coke@cmua"". In fact, you could discover the
  Coke machine's status from any machine anywhere on the Internet!  Not
  that it would do you much good if you were a few thousand miles away...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the first generation Coke Machine, in the 70s and 80s, the <code>finger</code> command was (ab)used while connecting through <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET"">ARPANET</a>, the precursor of the Internet. Not exactly a complex protocol, but it worked well enough to indicate the state of the coke machine without being overly difficult to set up.</p>

<p>If you're interested in <em>exactly</em> how the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_protocol""><code>finger</code> command</a> worked, here is an extract from Wikipedia detailing how it operates:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The finger daemon runs on TCP port 79. The client will (in the case of remote hosts) open a connection to port 79. An RUIP (Remote User Information Program) is started on the remote end of the connection to process the request. The local host sends the RUIP one line query based upon the Finger query specification, and waits for the RUIP to respond. The RUIP receives and processes the query, returns an answer, then initiates the close of the connection. The local host receives the answer and the close signal, then proceeds closing its end of the connection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>finger</code> command can also provide some custom information, such as full name, email address, and some custom text. Presumably the custom text was used to send the state of the Coke Machine and the coldness of the Cokes inside.</p>

589,589,,,"<p>Wi-Fi outlets are at about 1.5-2 Watts of power consumption, that's the WeMo as mentioned in Jim's answer, and also a few other ones I've tried, like the TP HS110.</p>

<p>ZigBee outlets like the one from Samsung SmartThings should use less power due to the ZigBee protocol usage. According to their support forums, it's about 0.3W when the relay is off and 0.6W when it's on. <a href=""https://community.smartthings.com/t/samsung-power-outlet-power-consumption-when-off/34463"">SmartThings Community</a>.</p>

<p>My own old infrared controlled outlets draw even more power than the ZigBee ones, they need about 0.7W. Anyways, that's still less then the Wi-Fi outlets.</p>

<p><strong><em>However,</em></strong> you might need a hub for ZigBee devices which uses up all that saved power. Wi-Fi devices can often forgo such hubs and can be directly controlled via App or Alexa and the like. Thus, you should consider your use case. If you just want to remote control a handful you might use ZigBee/IR and a designated remote, if you want more those Wi-Fi sockets might be less power consuming after all.</p>

591,591,,,"<p>Z-Wave is a mesh networking technology commonly used for home automation that allows many different brands of products to interoperate with each other very easily.  However, it is a patented proprietary protocol that requires a licensed Z-Wave chip, which are not generally available to the hobbyist at affordable rates.  </p>

<p>To communicate, Z-Wave devices must be joined to the same Z-Wave mesh network. That means you need to have a primary controller somewhere, at least for the purpose of pairing.

<p>Some commercial Z-Wave switches are ""scene capable"", meaning you can install and use them as a typical wall switch, and they can trigger behavior directly in other Z-wave devices without needing to send a message to the primary controller.

624,624,658.0,3.0,"<p>I'm making an IoT device that will serve a web app over WiFi which can be accessed to control it.</p>

<p>I would like to make it easy to set up. For example, the easiest way I can imagine is as follows; all it would need is a phone or similar with NFC capabilities. (Only hypothetically, because this assumes NFC etc can do it!)</p>

<ol>
<li>User powers up IoT device</li>
<li>User holds phone against IoT device's NFC pad</li>
<li>IoT device asks phone for WiFi credentials</li>
<li>IoT device uses credentials to connect to WiFi</li>
<li>IoT device directs phone's browser to its URL</li>
</ol>

<p>But right away I can see possible flaws: </p>

<ul>
<li>Phone is unlikely to want to give credentials away; security risk.</li>
<li>Phone is unlikely to want to navigate to the given URL; security risk.</li>
<li>NFC probably doesn't have defined standards for these kinds of operations; even if security issues are mitigated (e.g. by asking user permission), I can't believe I'd be lucky enough for this to be implemented. So an app would have to be downloaded for the phone to do all this. Which means an app would need to be written for Apple, another for Android etc, plus in the case of Apple it would have to be approved, and either way the user would have to search for it, install it and learn how to use it - all defeating the purpose of having a web interface. </li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously some users will not have NFC-compatible phones, so there would also have to be a secondary method. </p>

<p>The only awareness of a solution I have comes from how my WiFi IP security camera works. It requires first connecting it via Ethernet cable to a router with on a 192.168.1.X subnet with a given IP reserved (e.g. my camera required 192.168.1.100 to be reserved or free). Then from there, the user navigates to <a href=""http://192.168.1.100/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://192.168.1.100/</a>, logs in with the camera's supplied username and password, then from there, configures the camera with the WiFi access point name and password. </p>

<p>But that method had one serious disadvantage: it required that the router operates on the subnet 192.168.1.X. Mine operated on 192.168.0.X. Thankfully I was able to reconfigure it. But my new router doesn't have that ability!! I would have been stuck. Additionally, the above method is quite a pain; quite a few steps. </p>

<p>What other solutions have been implemented to solve the problem of setting up an IoT device's WiFi connection, and then informing the user of its IP address so he/she can access its web interface?</p>

<p>Congratulations. This sounds like a good idea. The first thing to worry about is power. Wait! Actually, that is the second. The fist is whether you want to create a new device, or whether it might not be better/easier to develop an app for a smartphone.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But can be operate remotely from any location in the world using its GPS ID.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need to define “operate”.</p>

<p>I am going to make a guess that you are trying to track the device (which is <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> the same as tracking the device owner), by their GPS location. Is that all that you want to do? Just track the wearer? Or maybe you want them to be able to trigger an alarm? Anything else?</p>

<p>If you want to make your own gadget, then <a href=""https://www.adafruit.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AdaFruit</a> have a good line in <a href=""https://www.adafruit.com/category/65"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wearables</a>  which you can use as a basis.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don't want to use WiFi, Bluetooth, internet or any communication protocol. 
  Then you won’t be able to track the device. GPS does not allow sending data over the GPS satellite, only recovering position and time data from it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you need to send the position back to a server (and I am sure that you do), then the following can be used, in increasing order of cost:  </p>

<ul>
<li>WiFi</li>
<li>Packet data / SMS   </li>
<li>satellite  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>WiFi</strong> : cheap, and free in many places, but you can’t guarantee coverage.  Places like Singapore might have almost countrywide coverage of free wifi, but otherwise, I would not expect it, even in big cities like London or New York. In fact, for a security device, you would <strong><em>never</em></strong> want to rely on free wifi.</p>

<p><strong>Packet data / SMS</strong> :  depending on the data/call plans, choose whether it is cheaper to send data as TCP or use a RESTful API. If that seems too expensive, consider using SMS – lots of existing apps do, but many of them do it for legacy reasons and have been doing so for decades. </p>

<p><strong>Satellite</strong> : is pushing it slightly for “wearable”, but it could be done as a belt, and easily in a small rucksack. It is also  your only option (except for some tricky radio stuff, but that it beyond my ken). </p>

631,631,,,"<p>Some devices support connecting to a router through <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Setup"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS)</a>, which is a feature of most modern routers to allow any device to connect to your network (with a limited period of time to initiate the connection) once you've pressed the WPS button on the router.</p>

<p>The button tends to look like this:</p>

<p>By doing this, you don't <em>need</em> any input to your IoT device - simply press the button to connect to your network <em>et voila</em>!</p>

<p>This issue is also explored further in <a href=""http://embedded-computing.com/articles/connecting-devices-to-the-internet-of-things-with-wi-fi/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Connecting devices to the Internet of Things with Wi-Fi</em></a>. Along with the WPS idea that I initially suggested, they have a few other options:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another common approach is to have the coffee maker appear as an access point with its own SSID and pass phrase, which is supplied on the manufacturer's quick start card. In this approach, when the coffee maker is plugged in and powered on the SSID of the coffee maker is broadcast so that it is easily identified. A user disconnects from the wireless network, connects wirelessly and directly to the coffee maker, and navigates to an area to enter the SSID and network pass phrase. The device is then configured as a client on the user's network.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This method would seem most practical for any network where you are unable to use WPS (no WPS support from your router, perhaps, or <a href=""http://www.howtogeek.com/176124/wi-fi-protected-setup-wps-is-insecure-heres-why-you-should-disable-it/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">concerns about WPS security</a>).

637,637,795.0,2.0,"<p>With <a href=""https://getperch.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Perch</a>, it seems that you can use an old Android smartphone with a camera as a webcam, which seems like a great idea to reuse old devices that you no longer want.</p>

<p>However, in normal usage, phones tend to use a <em>lot</em> of energy in my experience (some phones barely last a day on battery in normal usage!), and the camera seems to use even more than usual, so I'm concerned that there may be a lot of power consumption. </p>

<p>If I reused a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S_III"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Samsung Galaxy S3</a> with Perch, is it likely to cost more than just buying a webcam and connecting it to my network, or is the difference negligible?</p>

<hr>

<p>In regards to what I'm comparing, I'm interested in whether (cost of webcam + electricity) would be cheaper than (cost of electricity for phone). If the webcam only pays for itself after 5 or 10 years, I'm not too concerned and won't bother buying it, but if I'm going to see savings after 6 months it might be more valuable.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, Perch just runs the camera 24/7 and communicates via Wi-Fi, but I've turned Bluetooth and mobile data off, along with GPS, since I don't need them.</p>

<p>As requested by Mawg, an example of the sort of thing the <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/D-Link-DCS-932L-Wireless-Night-Camera/dp/B004P8K24W/ref=sr_1_2?s=computers&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483786206&amp;sr=1-2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">D-Link DCS-932L</a>, which says the maximum power consumption is 2W on <a href=""http://monitoring.indihome.co.id/views/DCS-932L.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the datasheet</a>. There isn't any information on the <em>typical</em> power consumption, however, so an answer with some explanation on what might typically be expected could be helpful.</p>

<p>I'm not particularly interested in any additional features such as low-light vision, although it would be a bonus. Motion detection <strong>would</strong> be useful though, since Perch does seem to support this by default and it would be advantageous. Notifications of motion would be good as well.</p>

<p>The camera will be situated inside, so I wouldn't expect any temperature extremes or dampness (otherwise I have a much bigger problem!).</p>

650,650,,,"<p>At first glance, I was expecting the brush itself to be powered by a motor, which would have provided lots of scope for reusing the device. Disappointingly, this doesn't seem to be the case - the hairbrush still requires you to manually brush your hair, but it does have an awful lot of sensors to take advantage of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Kérastase Hair Coach Powered by Withings minimizes these risks, taking advantage of multiple sensors that provide information on the quality of hair and brushing patterns. These include: </p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>A microphone that listens to the sound of hair brushing to identify patterns, providing insights into manageability, frizziness, dryness, split ends and breakage.  </li>
  <li>3-axis load cells that measure the force applied to the hair and the scalp when brushing. </li>
  <li>An accelerometer and a gyroscope which help further analyze brushing patterns and count brush strokes, with haptic feedback signaling if brushing is too vigorous.</li>
  <li>Conductivity sensors to determine if the brush is being used on dry or wet hair in order to provide an accurate hair measurement. The brush itself is splash proof.</li>
  </ul>

<hr>

<p>With this information, I think there's a lot of choice for what to use the brush for. <a href=""http://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/technology/2017/01/160-smart-hairbrush-symbolises-big-problem-internet-things"">New Statesman</a> has a rather nefarious idea for what could be done:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Munro hasn’t yet looked at the Hair Coach, but he speculates about the security of any IoT device with a microphone and internet connection. “Listening to hair breakage requires a microphone, so can it hear more than just breaks? It’s clearly very sensitive, so could it detect human voice and potentially become a spy bug?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could, in theory, take advantage of the hair brush's microphone to act as a sound detector (perhaps for security?), although I doubt the microphone is particularly sensitive - its original purpose only requires it to pick up sounds within a 10 or 20 centimetre radius. </p>

<p>Even so, if you put the brush in a key location, the microphone could perhaps detect someone walking past, and you could write some software to push a notification to your phone and inform you.</p>

<p>It's hard to know exactly how (or <em>if</em>) this could be done without more information on the product, which we can't know until it's released, but I'm sure if you were inventive enough, you could overwrite whatever code they have installed (unless the device only contains read-only memory, which is a strong possibility).</p>

656,656,,,"<p>I have a D-Link 5020-L IP Camera.</p>

<p>Even without D-Link's soft, the messages are transmitted via plain HTTP and a basic autorization header. Which means that if somebody sniffs my home network they can easily get my login/password. And yes, if my router has opened ports my login/password is base64 encoded in the basic header so very easy to read.</p>

<p>As for the document I see two parts for what I have read at the beginning:</p>

<ul>
<li>the first part is ""insecure cameras"". Well yes, people still don't change the default password of their device. Robots simply perform standard queries to see if cameras are secure, then they list them.</li>
<li>the second part is ""easy to secure"" cameras written on the box. D-Link <em>assures</em> it is easy to secure a camera, but in fact no, people must have a strong knowledge of Wifi protocols (WPA,...) and these settings are hidden behind all the menus of the camera web interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>With my first point, I would say ""all the devices"" are impacted since the user must enable security. So, to answer your question: how?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Change the default password of the admin account!!!!</strong></li>
<li>If possible, rename the network host via the web interface or via your router, in that case if an attacker finds your device on the network, he won't know it is a [insert brand] camera.</li>
<li>Don't expose your camera's port with your router, unless it is a public camera and you have set a guest account.</li>

662,662,,,"<p>Generally you'd need some component to trigger and power the sensor and read the response. That sensor has a custom response and trigger which makes me doubt there is a standard ZigBee module out there which converts a command to that 10 µs trigger and reports back the response in verbatim. Thus, you'll need some sort of microcontroller with your ZigBee module to perform that task.</p>

<p>I'd probably get that microcontroller, the ZigBee module and a circuit prevent short circuiting on a board outside the well for humidity reasons and lead a four wire cable inside to the sensor. Since the sensor has only four meters of range it has to be very close to the potential high water maximum mark. Putting a small cable inside the well gets the other electronics out of range and puts the ZigBee module in a better position to relay the information to the Raspberry Pi.</p>

701,701,,,"<p>To me, this seems close to being an X-Y question. The medical professionals (and to some extent the laboratory equipment manufacturers) are pushing back against these low-cost, continuous measurment sensors, because they're not accurate - but failing to appreciate that there are probably other gains to be made from replacing high precision with high volume data (both in time, and across populations).</p>

<p>In common with lots of embedded applications, the Fitbit doesn't measure calorie burn directly. What it does it take some more tractable measurements and user data to provide an estimate based on identified modes of activity (for example -sleeping, jogging, walking). Across a group of individuals, there is potential for significant variation between the observed parameters and actual calorie burn.</p>

<p>Where the data can be expected to be more accurate is in comparing relative calorie burn with different days for a specific individual, and the obvious advantage is the trivial instrumentation overhead compared with attempting any precision calorimitry in an open-air activity.</p>

<p>Its important to appreciate that the calorie number is an estimate, but when does anyone care about anything precise with calories? Even with blood pressure, the value is being able to identify changes over time in the majority of even medically monitored applications (rather than one-off diagnostic measurements).</p>

<p><a href=""http://lovemyecho.com/2015/11/11/echo-custom-wake-words-why-isnt-this-a-thing-yet/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This blog</a> post explains it about the <em>Echo</em> and the wake word <em>Alexa.</em> I'll summarize a bit.</p>

<p>Wake word recognition is done <a href=""http://iot.stackexchange.com/a/367/78"">locally and in real-time</a>. That limits the lengths of the wake word due to obvious processing limitations. Furthermore users don't want to recite a poem to activate the smart assistant. Thus, <strong><em>it has to be short.</em></strong></p>

<p>It has to work with an almost 100% accuracy when called and also <em>not recognized</em> with that certainty when not called for. That makes problems and also makes for a <strong><em>minimum length for wake words.</em></strong> Amazon's choice to allow <em>Echo</em> is quite surprising since it's just two <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">syllables</a>.</p>

<p>If we look at the usual suspects, we have <em>Alexa (3 syllables), Amazon (3), Echo (2), Ok Google (4), Hey Cortana (4),</em> and <em>Hey Siri (3).</em> All industry giants almost agree on three being a good choice number of syllables.</p>

<p>Strangely enough the most wanted wake word <em>""computer""</em> has also three syllables and would match that requirement easily. It's also not trademarked.</p>

<p>As the blog—and reason—tells us, we totally want to avoid false positives. Let's have a look about how established the words Computer, Siri, Cortana and Alexa are. This is the Google book corpus from 2008.</p>

<p><a href=""https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=alexa%2C+cortana%2C+siri%2C+computer&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Calexa%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Csiri%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Ccomputer%3B%2Cc0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GjhHO.png"" alt=""Ngram computer outshines alexa and siri""></a></p>

<p>Exactly, Siri and Alexa are virtually flatlining against <em>computer</em> and <em>Cortana</em> gives an error. Not found. Makes sense since the corpus is from 2008. To give us some more perspective why <em>computer</em> is a terrible wake word another graph.</p>

<p><a href=""https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=computer%2Ctom%2Cdave%2Cqueen%2Cbasketball%2Cpolice%2Csophia%2Caiden%2Cmary&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Ccomputer%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Ctom%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cdave%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cqueen%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cbasketball%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cpolice%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Csophia%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Caiden%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cmary%3B%2Cc0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VQ7KG.png"" alt=""ngram of computer versus other words""></a></p>

<p>This Ngram shows the two most popular US baby names of 2016 (for currency), as well as Tom and Dave also flatline against <em>computer</em>. Queen, basketball and police manage to register properly. Anyhow this gives us an idea why <em>Computer, Earl Grey, Hot</em> hasn't been allowed so far. People use the word <em>computer</em> way too often.</p>

<p>One more thing about false positives. Alexa rhymes with virtually nothing one would say.</p>

If they are connected to GPIO pins of the controller, a custom firmware could enable you to switch them of or even use PWM to dim them down.

<p>If the LEDs cannot be toggled from the system and are hardwired it is still possible to tweak the hardware. The LEDs in question are D8..D11 on the PCB. Opening the case (and voiding the warranty and all) you could try to trace the connections of these LEDs that will eventually lead to some resistors. Removing those resistors and replacing them with higher values will reduce the current and thus the luminous flux.</p>

<p>If you cannot find the resistors and just want to disable the LEDs you can simply remove them... or block the lightpath inside the housing (covering the LEDs). This way the device will at least keep a pristine look from the outside. </p>

Once inside, tampering is often not recorded or noticed, and can occur unimpeded. This is simply not possible when using blockchain.”</p>

<p>Below is a quick breakdown with a source explaining with an example in more detail but essentially it makes it so there are multiple approvers that approve a transaction, some level of access, etc. so if something slips through the cracks of one, it still has to make it through the other levels of approval.</p>

<p>World Economic Forum explains it on their website as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What is blockchain?</strong></p>
  
  <p>Currently, most people use a trusted middleman such as a bank to make
  a transaction. But blockchain allows consumers and suppliers to
  connect directly, removing the need for a third party.</p>
  
  <p>Using cryptography to keep exchanges secure, blockchain provides a
  decentralized database, or “digital ledger”, of transactions that
  everyone on the network can see. This network is essentially a chain
  of computers that must all approve an exchange before it can be
  verified and recorded.</p>
  
  <p><strong>How does it work in practice?</strong></p>
  
  <p>In the case of Bitcoin, blockchain stores the details of every
  transaction of the digital currency, and the technology stops the same
  Bitcoin being spent more than once.</p>

<p><a href=""http://emqtt.io/docs/v2/guide.html#sys-topics"">emqtt's User Guide</a> shows a system topic that offers some Broker Statistics, i.e. <code>$SYS/brokers/${node}/stats/clients/count</code> provides the count of current connected clients. Note that this will not list any specifics about the connected clients - so I take it that is not what is needed here. </p>

<p>Last will (LWT, Last Will and Testament) messages are otoh not a system topic but a regular topic as set up by the client during connect. If you want to monitor that topic simply subscribe to it. Note however that LWT messages are discarded if a client disconnects gracefully by sending a DISCONNECT message (see <a href=""http://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-essentials-part-9-last-will-and-testament"">hiveMQ blog</a>, great read btw).</p>

<p><a href=""http://emqtt.io/docs/v2/commands.html#clients"">emqtt's User Guide</a> presents a better way to monitor connecting and disconnecting clients:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <code>./bin/emqttd_ctl</code> command line could be used to query and administrate the EMQ broker (not working on Windows). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that monitoring <code>clients list</code> - list all MQTT clients - and <code>clients show &lt;ClientId&gt;</code>- show a MQTT Client - are most helpful here. The planned separate process to monitor clients therefore does not need to subscribe to the broker but simply utilize <code>./bin/emqttd_ctl</code> instead. </p>

  <p>Blockchain, Gada explains, is “a suitable solution in at least three
  aspects of IoT, including big data management, security and
  transparency, as well as facilitation of micro-transactions based on
  the exchange of services between interconnected smart devices.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>big data management:</strong> I couldn't disagree more. Blockchains are inherently inefficient at processing and storing large amounts of data. All data must be relayed to and processed by every full node, and is stored forever by every archival node. Bitcoin transactions are tiny at about 250 byte a piece, and the Bitcoin blockchain is currently growing at a rate of about one gigabyte per week – it's now 117GB in size. Contrary to popular narrative, blockchains are a terrible solution to most problems that they are hyped to solve.</p>

<p><strong>security:</strong> Security of what? Blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin are secured by their protocols paying large rewards of native tokens to the validators. The validators in turn provide work by spending irretrievable resources, which would have to be replicated to change the recorded history. This makes their blockchain essentially write-only and immutable. Additionally, the rules make sure that only the owner of assets can reassign them.<br>
From the excerpt, it neither becomes clear who would be validating the state of the network, nor what the supposed ""assets"" stored in the database would be or how the convergence and validation of the network would be incentivized.</p>

<p><strong>transparency:</strong> Agreed, open blockchains are public goods and every participant can be as transparent as they want.</p>

<p><strong>micro-transactions:</strong> It is very unlikely that micro-transactions will be solved directly on a blockchain. Again, we're talking about a terribly inefficient data structure that requires replication of all information in the network. Bitcoin transactions currently cost about $0.15 a piece. There is a real cost associated to storing every transaction forever on the blockchain. Second layer systems being built on top of blockchains such as <a href=""http://raiden.network"">Raiden</a> on Ethereum and the <a href=""http://lightning.network"">Lightning Network</a> on Bitcoin may provide cheaper micro transactions in the future, but even then each payment channel would need to be anchored to the blockchain with a blockchain transaction, so there is a palpable minimum value to be transferred before this becomes cost-effective.</p>

<p>I'd like to end with pointing out an article by Gideon Greenspan of MultiChain on <a href=""http://www.multichain.com/blog/2015/11/avoiding-pointless-blockchain-project/"">Avoiding the pointless blockchain project</a>. It seems to me that the proposed project here infringes on multiple points, e.g.:</p>

<ul>
<li>We already trust the producer with the firmware, why then would we not trust them with updates of it?</li>
<li>For the same reason, why would we need multiple arbitrary writers? Aren't we just trusting the producer of the hardware anyway?</li>
<li>What sort of interaction is there between transactions?</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems plausible to me that multiple publish-subscribe databases in combination with digital signature cryptography would offer the sought benefits. (But maybe I'm missing something.)</p>

<li>The main thing I want to do is to set up some lights that can be turned on and off via voice commands, but my wife and kids can still just use the switch. Thus, I think I want to get a SmartThings hub and some <a href=""https://www.smartthings.com/works-with-smartthings/-/filter/categories/switches-and-dimmers"">compatible light switches</a>, and then I can turn the lights on and off via Google Home voice commands or manually on the switch. Plus I can add smart outlets, thermostats, and locks in the future. Hue light bulbs look like they would be easier to install, but it doesn't look like they would work well with turning them on and off via a traditional light switch. Am I going to be better off with the SmartThings compatible light switches? Or do Hue light bulbs actually work just fine with traditional light switches?</li>
<li>However, one other things I'd like to do is set up our front outside lights to turn on at sunset and then off at sunrise/sometime in the middle of the night. We currently leave these light switches on all the time and put a <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B004YWEQQY"">light control</a> in the bulb sockets to turn them off during the day. But those are ugly, like to turn on during the day when they're in the shade, and have no option to turn off in the middle of the night. It looks like Hue light bulbs would be the best thing to use to replace this set up. But if I'm already getting a SmartThings hub from question 1, will that work with Hue light bulbs? Or do I need to get a separate Hue hub?</li>

<p><strong>A VPN</strong> can be used to logically move your android device to inside your home network. It is possible (but unlikely) that your router provides this functionality. In practice, you need a device within your home network to act as a host for the VPN. I use a NAS device (which comes with the DNS features as well), but you could implement this yourself using a single board computer (such as a Raspberry Pi).</p>

<p><strong>Router Port Forwarding</strong> This is technically possible, but less likely to work in your case. It would work if the device in your house has a web interface, but doesn't work so easily if you have an app which you need to redirect from an external network. You can configure your router to pass an HTTP access on a special port (public_ip:12380) to port 80 on your entertainment device (192.168.1.xx:80). This would be OK (and easy) if you have a device running Kodi for example, this had a web remote-control.</p>

It has Bluetooth 3.0 capability by the SIM808. The board itself implements a battery management system, capable of performing weight, humidity and temperature measurements and also can detect device displacements. All collected data is transferred by GPRS connection to a remote server.</p>

<p>The device itself can be installed into beehives, but it would not be cost effective to have a SIM card for hundreds of hives. So this will only act as a <strong>master</strong>, that have data logging capabilities as well beside the GPRS capability.</p>

<p>Thus, I am planning to implement <strong>slave</strong> boards without the SIM808 modules. So instead of the SIM808, a simple wireless communication unit is needed to enable local, wireless communication between the hives.</p>

<p>The master would query all the slaves for their data, and then it would  transfer everything via GPRS.</p>

<p>It should look like this, only with a hundred hives:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q4gFU.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q4gFU.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Now <strong>the possibilities</strong> for local wireless communication:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bluetooth, as I said the master device already have Bluetooth 3.0. But I am not entirely sure that Bluetooth is the right way to query a hundred slave for 1 kBs of data.</li>
<li>The master device has an I2C bus, so I can connect I2C compatible ZigBee or other RF module which could be added to the slave boards as well.</li>
</ol>

<p>Collectable data from slaves won't exceed 1 kB/query.</p>

<p>So all in all can I stay at Bluetooth or should I add ZigBee for example to my devices or are there any other options?</p>

<p>Some more details:</p>

<ul>
<li>range is max 30 meters</li>
<li>also as the devices are battery powered, a solution with low power consumption would be good</li>
<li>the master would run a query in every 15 mins</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The main goal is to make the master able</strong> to query the slaves efficiently, and this should be done <strong>without modifying the PCB of the master</strong>. The two possibilities are Bluetooth 3.0, which is already available for the master, or other technologies that I can connect to the master board via the I2C bus of the on-board MCU. (I do not insist on using Bluetooth, it was the starting point because I already had a BT 3.0 by the SIM808.)</p>

<p>Let us assume that you want to transmit data for 2 seconds every minute, and then sleep for the rest of the time. Given your range requirements of 30 metres, you will likely need to use a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth#Uses"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Class 1 Bluetooth Radio</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Class 1, primarily for industrial use cases, [have a range of up to] 100 metres (300 ft). Bluetooth Marketing qualifies that Class 1 range is in most cases 20–30 metres (66–98 ft)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would imagine the lower range would occur in situations where there was not a clear path for the radio transmissions, and perhaps in challenging radio environments. Outside, I would imagine this is less of a problem.</p>

<p>So, assuming the above is true: you will be transmitting for <strong>1/30th</strong> of an hour,  at approximately <strong>100mW</strong> during the transmission phase.</p>

<p>Hence, per hour, you will consume approximately <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(2%2F60)+hours+*+0.1W"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">0.00333 Wh</a> of energy. For comparison, a 'long-life' alkaline AA battery stores around <a href=""http://www.allaboutbatteries.com/Energy-tables.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2.6 Wh of energy</a>. Therefore, your battery would last about <strong>30 days with Bluetooth 3.0</strong>, which isn't <em>really</em> bad, but could be a lot better.</p>

<p>These calculations are all very rough, but they should be in the ballpark if the assumptions are correct. <a href=""http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1273485"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">EE Times</a> suggests that 5% of the time transmitting is on the high end, and my estimate of 2 seconds / minute is roughly 3.33%.</p>

<hr>

<p>Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) might be more viable; <a href=""https://www.link-labs.com/bluetooth-zigbee-comparison/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this page</a> suggests 10mW power for a 77m range, which would give a battery life closer to <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(2.6+%2F+((2%2F60)+*+0.01))+%2F+24"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1 year</a> (325 days, more precisely!). However, this would require new hardware, which is, admittedly, a disadvantage.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in a comment, this sort of setup seems perfect for a mesh network, and that <em>should</em> reduce your range requirements significantly, since you won't have to transmit 30 metres to the hub, just 2 or 3 metres to the next beehive. In that case, you could probably get away with a much less powerful radio, which would save battery life.</p>

<p>It may be worth considering one of the mesh protocols such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZigBee"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ZigBee</a> or the new <a href=""https://blog.bluetooth.com/bluetooth-and-mesh-smart-combination"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BLE Mesh</a> protocol, which would both suit your use-case well.</p>

<p>This makes some sense since broadcasters may use in-band signaling to identify adverts (for localised replacement), and the audio processing typically applied to adverts might be optimised for clarity over fidelity.

799,799,,,"<p>Generally you want your home's door secure.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Assuming that the door is secure in itself, i.e. it cannot be opened without the lock, the security of the door is equivalent to the security of said <em>(smart)</em> lock. Further assuming that the the smart lock itself is secure for the moment we can concentrate on the trigger.</p>

<h3>Triggering a smart lock with a voice assistant</h3>

<p>Generally there are three options to verify that only an authorized person can open the door. Those are called authentication factors, either the person <strong><em>knows</em></strong> something, the person <strong><em>has</em></strong> something or the person <strong><em>is</em></strong> someone. Those can be combined into <em>two-factor</em>, <em>three-factor</em> or even more-factor authentications. The corresponding <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication#Factors_and_identity"">Wikipedia page</a> is an interesting read about those. The voice assistants currently are unable to discern between voices.</p>

<p>That inability excludes possibility three, identifying you <strong><em>being</em></strong> you outside your door. On its own, it's obviously unable to check you for <strong><em>having</em></strong> something specific too. That leaves one authentication factor, you <strong><em>knowing</em></strong> something.</p>

<p>Thus, you'll have to configure Google Home or SmartThings or the smart lock to not react to generic commands, but only to specific ones you set. The simplest thing would be renaming your smart lock device. It would leave you for example with the command, <em>Ok, Google, open the hidden kingdom.</em></p>

<p>As with every authentication that is based on <strong><em>knowing</em></strong> something, which is essentially a password, or in this case more aptly a passphrase, the usual rules apply. </p>

<ul>
<li>Change it from the default value</li>
<li>Change it regularly</li>
<li>Make the passphrases hard to guess (and easy to remember)</li>
<li>Don't tell anyone unauthorized</li>
</ul>

<p>Since you literally have to say that passphrase in semi-public with passing neighbors, in front of guests and in easy reach of malicious listeners you'd optimally never use a passphrase twice.</p>

<p>This is why I haven't provided any actual configuration possibilities. Without adding another factor to the voice activated smart lock this is just a truly insecure idea.</p>

<p>Possible second factors could be a face-recognition camera being activated by voice which verifies your identity and opens the lock or a proximity check for your smart phone. Thus, adding factor <strong><em>being</em></strong> someone or <strong><em>having</em></strong> something to the really weak <strong><em>knowing</em></strong>.</p>

<h2>AES</h2>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard"">AES</a> is one of the most popular symmetric-key encryption algorithms (which means you use the same key to encrypt and decrypt). In terms of security, AES is a safe bet:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Best public cryptanalysis</h3>
  
  <p>Attacks have been published that are computationally faster than a full brute force attack, though none as of 2013 are computationally feasible.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>- <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard"">Wikipedia</a></em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The paper <a href=""http://www.webcitation.org/68GTcKdoD?url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/cryptanalysis/aesbc.pdf""><em>Biclique Cryptanalysis of the Full AES</em></a> describes that AES-128 requires 2<sup>126.1</sup> operations, AES-192 requires 2<sup>189.7</sup> operations, and AES-256 requires 2<sup>254.4</sup> operations to break. On a 2.9 GHz processor, assuming each 'operation' is 1 CPU cycle (probably not true), breaking AES-128 would take <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(2%5E126.1)%2F(2.9*1000000)+seconds+to+days""><strong>a very long time</strong></a>. With 10 000 of them running, it will still take <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(2%5E126.1)%2F(2.9*1000000*10000)+seconds+to+days"">nearly forever</a>. So, security isn't a concern here; let's consider the power aspect.</p>

<p><a href=""https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8fba/0a5577f70b5dacbf322ce0e248cb5ad1b615.pdf"">This paper</a> shows (on page 15) that encrypting a block with AES used 351 pJ. I'll compare this a little later after talking about some other common algorithms.</p>

<h2>SIMON</h2>

<p>I asked a question about <a href=""http://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/230/what-exactly-makes-speck-and-simon-particularly-suitable-for-iot-devices"">SIMON and SPECK</a> previously, which is worth a read. Where SIMON excels is in situations where you need to encrypt <strong>a little bit of data, frequently</strong>. The paper I linked earlier states that SIMON 64/96 uses 213 pJ for 64 bits, which is practical when you only need to send 32 bits of payload.</p>

<p>SIMON 64/96 is <a href=""https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/526.pdf"">significantly easier to break</a> than AES though; the paper I linked suggests a 2<sup>63.9</sup> operations, so our 10 000 CPU setup <em>could</em> crack the encryption <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(2%5E63.9)%2F(2.9*1000000*10000)+seconds+to+days"">in only a few years</a>, as opposed to millions of millennia.</p>

<h2>Does it really matter?</h2>

<p>At the rate you plan to transmit, the answer is almost certainly <strong>no</strong>; the energy usage from cryptography will be entirely negligible. For AES, <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(351+pJ+%2F+10+minutes)+to+pJ%2Fday"">you would use 50 544 pJ per day</a>, so a <a href=""http://www.allaboutbatteries.com/Energy-tables.html"">cheap carbon-zinc AA battery</a> with 2340 J of energy would last <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2340J+%2F+((351+pJ+%2F+10+minutes)+to+pJ%2Fday)"">far beyond the device's lifetime</a>. If you re-evaluate the calculations with SIMON, you find that it <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2340J+%2F+((213+pJ+%2F+10+minutes)+to+pJ%2Fday)"">also has a <strong>very</strong> long lifetime</a></p>

<p><strong>In short, unless you're transmitting <em>very</em> frequently, the radio is far more of a concern for power</strong>. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_low_energy"">Wikipedia</a> quotes the power usage as between 0.01 and 0.5 W. If you transmit for <strong>1 second at 0.01 W</strong>, <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.01W+*+1+second+%3E+(((213+pJ+%2F+10+minutes)+to+pJ%2Fday)+*+1+day)"">you've already used more power than AES did over the whole day</a>.</p>

<p>For BLE, though, you're probably fine just relying on the default security; <a href=""https://www.bluetooth.com/~/media/files/specification/bluetooth-low-energy-security.ashx?la=en"">BLE uses AES-CCM by default for link-layer security</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Encryption in Bluetooth with low energy uses AES-CCM cryptography. Like BR/EDR, the LE Controller will
  perform the encryption function. This function generates 128-bit encryptedData from a 128-bit key and
  128-bit plaintextData using the AES-128-bit block cypher as defined in FIPS-1971.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is <a href=""http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/100443/security-of-bluetooth-low-energy-ble-link-layer-encryption"">some concern</a> that there are security flaws with BLE's implementation of the link-layer security though; <strong>this is not a flaw in AES; rather Bluetooth SIG decided to roll their own key exchange mechanism in 4.0 and 4.1</strong>.

  <li><strong>Listening</strong>: When Alexa’s microphone(s) have been activated, she is in a listening state and is waiting for voice input. </li>
  <li><strong>Microphone Off</strong>: On a voice-initiated implementation, the customer can block Alexa from activating by turning on microphone off
  mode, which physically powers down the microphones and (if available)
  camera.</li>
  </ul>

<p>The idea is simple. The device would be capable of recognising words, just some words nothing too difficult.</p>

<p>By default, it would keep Alexa in <strong>Microphone Off</strong> state, so it won't pick up voices from its environment.</p>

<p>When Alexa goes back to <strong>Idle</strong> the proxy should automatically switch it to <strong>Microphone Off</strong> state.</p>

<p>Disappointingly, developing a skill to mute the microphones also seems to be impossible. Your skill must return a JSON response in <a href=""https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/alexa-skills-kit-interface-reference#response-format"">this format</a>, with the following keys:</p>

<li><code>response</code>

<ul>
<li><code>outputSpeech</code> - The words you want Alexa to say</li>
<li><code>card</code> - Data for a 'card' in the Alexa app to display</li>
<li><code>reprompt</code> - The text to use if the user doesn't respond appropriately and needs re-prompting</li>
<li><code>directives</code> - Device-level actions that are executed using an interface in the Alexa API</li>
<li><code>shouldEndSession</code> - Ends the current chat session with your skill</li>

<p>I suspect Amazon deliberately do not support this yet because Alexa can run on <em>many</em> different devices; some are push-to-talk, some are tap-to-talk (e.g. the Amazon Tap), and some are wake word initiated ('always listening').

<blockquote>
  <p>Alexa reads Kindle books eligible for Text-to-Speech (an experimental reading technology that allows supported Amazon devices to read Kindle books aloud). </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Concept</h2>

<p>If it is possible I want to use this feature but instead of reading Kindle books, Alexa should read custom texts or reports made by some smart-home devices. So during the day different devices would report different events like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Temperature sensor: <code>New ""highest temperate ever measured"": 30 °C.</code></li>
<li>Connected dog-feeder: <code>The dog food container is empty.</code></li>
<li>Some kind of sensor: <code>This happened while you was away and you should know about.</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Basically a service would collect all the data from the sensors and would create a report file that could be used with Alexa like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Alexa, read 'Afternoon home report'.</li>
<li>Alexa, read 'Morning home report'.</li>
</ul>

<p>(<strong>So I could ask Alexa at the end of the day ""What happened today?"" and it could tell me by reading the reports.</strong>)</p>

<h2>Problems</h2>

<p>The reports should be in a correct format to make them eligible for Alexa to read them. I found something about it on Amazon forum, <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/forum/kindle?_encoding=UTF8&amp;cdForum=Fx1D7SY3BVSESG&amp;cdThread=Tx21T5B0Y0UWZSY"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Can I enable Text to Speech on any personal document?</a></p>

  <p>Only if that document will open in the Reading App. Word documents, for instance, that have to be opened in a Word Process app or PDFs that have to 
  opened in a PDF Reader can't use the Text to Speech feature.</p>
  
  <p>All documents in a Kindle compatible format should have Text to Speech
  available but I send all mine via the Amazon Cloud and Amazon converts
  them to the Kindle format. A tap in the center of the screen reveals
  the ""Play"" icon in the bottom left hand corner.</p>

<h2>Possible solution</h2>

<p>One way I have found on <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/553vm4/how_do_we_get_our_echo_to_read_pdfs/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Reddit</a> describes the following:</p>

826,826,,,"<p>There's a base decision you'll have to make. Either using the <em>read a book</em> function or using an Alexa skill of your own. Only the latter one let's you use <em>Alexa, what happened today?</em> That phrase seems to start the build-in flash briefing—even though I couldn't find an entry in any documentation confirming it I tested it. You should also check if the <em>read a book</em> function is even available in your geography—for me, here, it's not.</p>

<p>Since you already need a system to aggregate a sensor data—otherwise you couldn't generate your report, you can also look into the skill route. Instead of generating an ebook you could also generate an rss-feed. If building a skill or having these information in a feed that will be hard or impossible to properly secure is out of the question the following information won't help you.</p>

<hr>

<p>There are basically three Alexa skill types and you'll certainly need one of them to have Alexa say anything at all. For obvious reasons <em>Smart Home Skill API</em> is out, since you don't want to control stuff. That leaves the <em>Custom Interaction Model</em> or the <em>Flash Briefing Skill API</em>. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aOq0J.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aOq0J.png"" alt=""AlexaSkillTypes""></a></p>

<p>The latter one is triggered by <em>Alexa, give me the news.</em> In the Alexa app you're able to define which <em>Flash Briefing</em> skills are triggered. Those can be several and they can be ordered however you like. If you're okay with the report you want to build to be in these information you can consider this skill type. The advantage of course being that the API already has a lot of stuff built in. The disadvantage is that your report is lodged in between the news report of the NY Times and the NBA results or whatever else you configure to be in your <em>Flash Briefing.</em></p>

<p>The Flash Briefing API is what's actually triggered when you ask, <em>Alexa, what happened today?</em> It's one of the invocation utterances for the flash briefing. So your dream utterance is already pre-defined to use this and if you're set on the phrase it's even the only solution.</p>

<p>Since the interaction model is pre-defined there is only one Alexa skill page to configure.</p>

827,827,,,"<p>According to <a href=""http://uk.tp-link.com/products/details/cat-5258_HS100.html#specifications"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this TPLink page</a> the HS-100 units are rated at 13A maximum. </p>

<p>You can switch a load of essentially any size by using the HS-100 to switch a secondary relay (solid state or electromechanical.)<br>
Electromechanical relays able to switch many kilowatts are available at prices that are usually well below the cost of the automation system switches. You may need a small amount of extra circuitry depending on the required coil voltage. If you use a relay with a mains-voltage AC coil you need only the relay plus an enclosure and whatever is required for connections. Note that solid state switches (SSRs) are both far more costly than 'old fashioned' relays, and inferior in energy losses. SSR2 typically drop 2 to 3 VAC across the operating relay. At 50A that would dissipate Power = V x I = 2V x 50A = 100 Watts (or 150W at 3V). This level of thermal energy requires heat sinking.  A mechanical relay such as the 90A Panasonic one listed below has a contact resistance of under 2 milliOhm worst case at end of lifetime for a energy loss at 50A of I^2 x R = 5 Watts (or 16 Watts at 90A). At 50A switched ~= 5.5 kW load the 5 Watts (or less) dissipation can be accommodated using standard mounting methods.  . </p>

In some applications dedicated  contactors such as the ""Functional Devices"" and ""Packard"" ones that Harper suggested may be good - but I'd want a far better specification sheet than in the links and rather more certainty of the quality regardless of volume sold. Such relays may be excellent - but know why you think any brand is and be sure that both the specifications AND the real world performance do in fact meet the application. Ideally buy through a known reputable supplier who guarantees ""provenance"". ebay and ""even"" Alibaba can be a source some very well priced high quality products.

836,836,,,"<h2>A general process of microcontroller selection.</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Sum up your requirements towards the microcontroller. For example in this case:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>1 hardware timer</strong>, to measure time between trigger and echo pulses.</li>
<li><strong>2 GPIO pins</strong> to interface the sensor Echo and Trigger pins.</li>
<li>Possibly <strong>UART</strong> to interface the RF communication module.</li>
<li><strong>1 ADC input</strong> to monitor the battery voltage.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>You can get along with a 8 pin controller for this, which might requires usage of the programmer pins for general purposes as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Decide the required <strong>CPU performance</strong> and <strong>memory requirements</strong>. Is it enough to use a 8-bit MCU or you need a 32-bit one instead? What CPU clock speeds are acceptable tens of MHz or 1 MHz is enough? How much program memory, RAM and ROM are needed?</p>

<p>Given the described application, you do not need high computing performance. Probably a 8-bit controller will suffice (though won't be much cheaper than a 32-bit one so you can decide here by the price maybe).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Low power</strong>. When it is not crucial you can probably get along with almost any kind of controller using its low power mode with the lowest supply voltage and system clock frequency.
If it is more important you can start narrowing down your search list by starting with dedicated low-power MCU cores like (ARM® Cortex®-M0 or M0+ CPU cores). Usually the datasheets contain tables for most of the <strong>low power modes/VCC/SysClk frequency</strong>, better ones will list the consumption of each peripherals as well.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Developer tools</strong>. I consider it as a very important aspect. Dedicated hardware programmer tools can cost fortunes so usually I stick to MCUs I have already had programmers for. When you switch to another family or brand it is good to invest into a development board that has an on-board programmer which could be used later to program your custom boards.

</ol>

<p>As @Sean has pointed out in the comments, a possible and cost effective solution would be to search for such RF modules that comes with an integrated, programmable application MCU, which can run your firmware while handling the RF communication part as well. Such modules exists for BLE, WiFi and ZigBee and possibly for many other technologies.</p>

<p>In addition about how will any MCU survive in the well. It will all comes down on the enclosure you will provide for the device. For example it won't matter much which MCU you choose if the enclosure is not 100% water resistant.</p>

It is <a href=""https://github.com/damellis/attiny/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Arduino compatible</a> so programming it won't cost you much (USBasp or AVRdude programmer costs about 2$ on eBay). (<strong>Note that</strong>: you should use Arduino Software Serial library to interface an RF communication module, as this MCU only has SPI by hardware.) All in all small, small, cheap, small, relatively low power consumption, the <strong>bit-banged UART might complicates it</strong> though.

843,843,,,"<p>Personally, I'd select a <a href=""http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/processor-microcontroller-development-kits/8968660/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Raspberry Pi 3B</a> for this, although it's probably far more powerful than you really need. The reasons for me suggesting this are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It has built-in 802.11 b/g/n Wireless LAN, so you'll be able to connect it to a Wi-Fi network rather than by Ethernet cable</p></li>
<li><p>It also supports Bluetooth, so you might be able to connect to the phone through that.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You will also need a display unit, and, conveniently, there are several displays designed for the Raspberry Pi, like <a href=""http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/lcd-colour-displays/9094105/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this 4DPI-32 touchscreen</a>. You should just be able to slot the display directly on to the 40-pin header:</p>

I'm aware this is technically a Pi 2B, but the GPIO is the same on the 3B.</sup></p>

<p>As for the programming aspect in this case, all you'd need to do is fetch the weather from an API somewhere, and display it on the screen as a GUI program. The display just functions like any HDMI output for the Pi, so you don't need to do anything special. For Python, you could use Tkinter to create a basic UI, or you might even choose to write a web application in HTML/CSS/JS, depending on what you're comfortable with. You could use the <a href=""https://openweathermap.org/api"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OpenWeatherMap API</a> for free; the documentation is linked for each API endpoint.</p>

<p>At this point, it's up to you really. The <em>best</em> language here is the language you're most comfortable with. If you like AngularJS, just create a HTML page, fetch the weather with Angular (or use a library like <a href=""https://github.com/JohnnyTheTank/angular-openweathermap-api-factory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> to help you) and display it using some CSS to make it look nice.</p>

<p>To actually get the location, I suspect it would be <em>easier</em> to just allow the user to type in their location on the Pi's touch screen. Sending the location of your phone is probably a little more difficult, although you might be able to find something if you research a lot.</p>

<p>Also, as pointed out in comments, check out the <a href=""https://igg.me/at/vocore2/x/277351"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">vocore2</a>, which actually seems to be smaller than the Onion, and cheaper at $4. It's currently being funded at IndieGoGo and estimated shipping dates are February 2017 (next month at the time of this writing). Also looks to have an assortment of docks available, and has a built-in wifi router, which is kinda cool.</p>

<p>I just came across those the other day and have no experience with them. Note, however, due to their newness, some of the Linux packages you may be used to using may not be available <em>yet</em> (for example, I know for a fact that at the time of this writing a gstreamer package is not available on the Onion yet, you have to build from source, although gstreamer is not relevant for you).</p>

<p>Short of those, like the other answer says, the Pi is a great low cost device. <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Don't forget the Raspberry Pi Zero</a>, another tiny $5 computer along the lines of the Onion. It doesn't have all the ports on board that the larger Pi's have but if you don't mind, or if you just want to use a 3 for development and a Zero for its size in final products, it's another choice worth considering.</p>

<p>Other devices, some expensive, include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://beagleboard.org/bone"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BeagleBone Black</a> (this is the only Pi alternative I'd seriously consider because of its low cost).</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.gumstix.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gumstix</a> ($$$, but we use these all the time in projects for their size)</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.udoo.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Udoo</a> ($$$ but packs a punch)</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.toradex.com/computer-on-modules/colibri-arm-family"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Toradex Colibri</a> (A bit hard to work with but we use these a lot, too, better specs than a Gumstix, and have the option of running Windows CE with an instant boot feature if you'd prefer a Windows toolchain and virtually zero boot time).</li>
</ul>

<p>Also note that <a href=""http://www.vilros.com/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-kits.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Vilros makes some <em>awesome</em> Pi starter kits</a> (cheaper on Amazon) pre-packaged with an OS, working Wifi, heat sinks, a case, works right out of the box and saves a ton of grunt setup work. Also worth checking out if you go the Pi route. Vilros also used to make Beaglebone starter kits, which no longer seem to be available on their site but if you search Newegg/Amazon/etc. you can still find available stock.</p>

<p>By the way, an Arduino (or another microcontroller, contrast with the full-blown single-board computers listed above) on its own probably <em>isn't</em> what you want here. The Arduino is just an Atmel ATmega168/328. It does not run an OS and doesn't really do anything besides precisely what you tell it to do. So for example, for networking you'd need the ethernet shield, which ships with a full ethernet control library that I believe provides a TCP and UDP stack (I've never used it, just browsing their site) and of course takes up a lot of limited code space. </p>

<p>Then you'd have to build your weather client and everything on top of that, and you've got to do it all in 32KB or less. It's a different flavor of development than doing Linux/Windows development on the Pi/Beaglebone/Gumstix/Colibri/etc. A bit outside the scope of this answer.</p>

<p>What the Arduino <em>is</em> good for here is as an add-on to your main system to do hardware interface stuff, like read pressure sensors, buttons, control basic electronic elements, that kind of thing. </p>

<p>Embedded systems development is a whole different beast than the desktop development you'd be doing on the Pi, and I really wouldn't recommend trying to do this with an Arduino alone, especially without experience.</p>

847,847,,,"<p>IPv6 is a necessity <strong>now</strong>; <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">we're nearly out of IPv4 addresses already</a>. As more and more people come online, we're starting to reach the point where IPs have to be shared across multiple people, not just one household (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">carrier-grade NAT</a>), which is unacceptable, and not just a problem for IoT.</p>

<p>IPv6 allows us to move to a more <em>semantic</em> representation where <strong>one IP = one device</strong>, which has several advantages. If you're directly able to address your smart device (be it a toaster, oven, light bulb, TV, or something else), you can just send your commands <strong>directly to the device</strong>, rather than needing to go through a hub. At the moment, NAT makes this difficult to set up, because it requires specifically port forwarding your IoT devices (and this may not work at all for carrier-grade NAT).</p>

<p>It might be worth reading <a href=""http://serverfault.com/questions/184524/switching-to-ipv6-implies-dropping-nat-is-that-a-good-thing"">'Switching to IPv6 implies dropping NAT. Is that a good thing?'</a> from Server Fault if you're worried about the security implication; having all your IoT devices given a public IPv6 address is not really a big security flaw; it's something that would still cause a problem on a NAT-enabled network.</p>

<p><a href=""http://iot.ieee.org/newsletter/july-2015/the-case-for-ipv6-as-an-enabler-of-the-internet-of-things.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This IEEE article</a> has some good points:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The next logical step from networks of mobile devices to networks of communicating ""Things"" is IoT. That next step will mirror the sequence of events experienced by mobile networks. Proprietary protocols came first, because an individual company’s profits often come before consideration of the common good. But the use of IP and transparency (i.e., open source protocols) is fundamental to IoT development, just as the ease of use and the invisibility of the technology is important to end users. Our view, based on our research, is that the value of transparency and ease-of-use, and even more importantly the need for interoperability, will favor IPv6 adoption by the IoT market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, in short:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>At the moment, 1 IPv4 address represents... <em>who knows?</em> Sometimes a device, sometimes a router, sometimes a whole network of different customers.</p></li>
<li><p>Using an IPv6 lets you give each IoT device a 'name' on the Internet.</p></li>

848,848,,,"<p>I suggest a step by step approach to find out what language and controller you should use. The microcontroller you need will depend on the tasks you want it to do. Theoretically the task will set up some requirements that an appropriate microcontroller will fulfill, so you should choose the microcontroller by these requirements.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Define a user story for the device. What do you expect from it? What do you want it to be capable of?</p>

<p>In your case it is already defined by you:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A battery powered device that should be capable of receiving inputs from a smart-phone and display weather information of requested locations on its own display.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Now step 1. gives you something to start with. You can decide what hardware you need on a block diagram level. </p>

<p>You will certainly need a display and possibly a WiFi or Bluetooth module to communicate with your mobile. Accessing global weather databases will possibly require Internet connection. You should control both of these with an MCU or the WiFi module (you need Internet so you can exclude Bluetooth) should be able to control the display and run your software.</p></li>
<li><p>You can start looking for specific parts. You can start with deciding what battery you will use, so you can take into consideration the power consumption of your potential parts. I have summed a general process for selecting MCUs in one of my <a href=""http://iot.stackexchange.com/a/881/14"">previous answer</a>. Basically the same should be done here. Find a cheap display, it will probably use an SPI or I2C interface for communication. Then you can search for either a Wifi module with SPI/I2C and has an integrated MCU or a separate MCU and a WiFi module. The individual WiFi module will probably use UART to communicate so the individual MCU should have that along the SPI/I2C.</p></li>
<li><p>As for the language. Most microcontroller will limit your possibilities in this field. In most cases your choices will be either C, C++ or Assembly, strictly speaking of microcontrollers here and not single board computers.</p>

<p>If you decide to go with a BeagleBone or Raspberry which can run Linux or other powerful OS then I say that the best language will be the one that you know the best, of course it should be able to handle the task. (<a href=""http://pi4j.com/example/control.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">You can run Java on the RPi if you like.</a>)</p>

<p>Opening a socket to a global weather data service can be done in C, C# or Python as well. Would be a bit more difficult to process JSON with C but certainly possible.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Speaking about costs in general. The best option is to search for WiFi enabled display devices, there will be a lot of results and most of them will use the same hardware, and probably this will be the cheapest.</p>

849,849,,,"<p>There are two reasons. </p>

<p>(1) <strong>First is simpler, end-to-end connectivity</strong>. If both source and destination have public IPv4 (or IPv6, of course) address, they can connect to each other in any direction anytime.</p>

<p>Your IoT with private IP <code>192.168.0.52</code> however can use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NAT</a> ONLY to connect to any public IP on the Internet whenever it wants, but the rest of the Internet cannot connect to it. There were kludges like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNAT"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DNAT</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upnp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">uPNP</a> that used to allow you to specify that some incoming connections are enabled, but they are breaking more and more nowadays due to implementation of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CGNAT</a> because of IPv4 shortages.</p>

<p>A common (so-called) ""solution"" to this problem is that all your (NATed) devices connect to some central location with public IP (usually hosted by the manufacturer of device). This makes it work technically, but involves a <strong>privacy</strong> issue (you're giving all the data from your IoTs), <strong>security</strong> issue (as you're wide open to them, breach or disgruntled employee can do anything your IoT device can do and access), and <strong>reliability</strong> issue (when the manufacturer goes out of business or decides to stop supporting old devices or is suffering outages) all your (and everybody elses) perfectly functional devices will stop working.</p>

<p>(2) <strong>second problem is that it will stop working anyway</strong> (even for outgoing connections) some time in the future (not in a year or two, but still. The more IoT and services catch on, the sooner it will start breaking).</p>

<p>That is because NAT allows private addresses like <code>192.168.0.52</code> to reach the Internet at large. It does that by changing source address <code>192.168.0.52</code> to public IP of your router, but replaces source port with free one from the pool. </p>

<p>For example, your first connection might be <code>192.168.0.52:1000</code> might be <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(CG)-NATed</a> to (public IP) <code>198.51.100.1:1000</code>, and your neighbour <code>192.168.0.77:1000</code> might get NATed to <code>198.51.100.1:1001</code>. Your second connection from <code>192.168.0.52:1001</code> would then be NATed to <code>198.51.100.1:1002</code> etc.</p>

<p>Problem is, even simple stuff like opening a web page will likely open dozens of connections and use a dozen of ports (for DNS queries, HTTP(S) connection for different elements, JS analytics on different sites etc). </p>

<p>More expensive programs, like torrent clients, will easily use up a <strong>thousands of ports</strong>. And there is only <strong>65535</strong> ports available for any IP.</p>

<p>Which means several of your neighbours sharing the same CGNAT IP use a bigger share of connections (and more IoTs will mean more connections), and suddenly all of 65535 ports on that public IP 198.51.100.1 are used. Which means no new connections can be established for you and your neighbours. Which on bigger scale means lots people are cut from their IoTs, and civilisation as we know it collapses :-)</p>

853,853,,,"<p>Creating a startup is not about what you can do with the technology and not even about the product. For a successful startup that can captivate VC's you should first think about the market that you are going to serve. But thinking about the market you will serve is not enough. You need to have real data about the market. It is not just about something that makes sense to you. Creating a product and then tying to sell it is not a successful approach and that is the way most unsuccessful startups end. A market is a REAL NEED. When you crate a product create it to address a specific Market. This is what makes a successful product, a product that sell itself because people are already looking for it. VC's invest only on startups that have such products especially if they are already selling. </p>

<p>To chose a technology to develop your product first you need to know what your product needs to do, this is how is it going to solve the problem in the selected Market. Then look at what the potential customers are willing to pay for it. Then chose the technology which allows the fastest time-to-market while keeping the cost within the budget. Then outsource the development or get a partner that can do it and is willing to work with you. Share the profits 50/50 with your partner. 
Then when you have a prototype, start laying-out your business plan and remember that you can only captivate VC's if you show them how they can make money.</p>

<p>If you need to lower the cost of your product for mass production you can use lower level languages and less resourceful micro-controllers like Microchip PIC or Silicon Labs EFM with ASM/C/C++. If the product is not going for mass production (100k+) use a higher level language and more resourceful micro-controllers, like Micro Python or Lua with ARM32 MIPS, or even Linux with ARM32/64. This saves on the development costs but increases the price of the hardware. Remember, the price of the product is not just a PCB with components; development, housing, packing and everything else necessary to sell the product should go into it's cost. Put that in the business plan. And don't go to a VC with an Arduino or a Raspberry pi or an Onion or any thing that looks like a hobbyist gadget, make a proper PCB with your logo on it and use a nice housing to make it look like a final product, VC's rarely trust hobbyist gadgets.</p>

It is appears to be a serious threat to security compromised Internet of Things devices.  According to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Mirai</strong> (Japanese for ""the future"") is malware that turns computer systems running Linux into remotely controlled ""bots"", that can be used as part of a botnet in large-scale network attacks. It primarily targets online consumer devices such as remote cameras and home routers. The Mirai botnet has been used in some of the largest and most disruptive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, including an attack on 20 September 2016  on computer security journalist Brian Krebs's web site, an attack on French web host OVH and the October 2016 Dyn cyberattack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article (and others I have read online) shows that Mirai makes the attack by grubbing the internet for devices that are using factory default usernames and passwords from a database.  Is it enough, then, to simply change your username and password on an IoT device?  Will that protect it from the Mirai attack, or does Mirai have other methods of making it in?</p>

These are: 127.0.0.0/8, 0.0.0.0/8, 3.0.0.0/8, 15.0.0.0/7, 56.0.0.0/8, 10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/14 , 100.64.0.0/10, 169.254.0.0/16, 198.18.0.0/15, 224.<em>.</em>.*+, {6, 7, 11, 21, 22, 26, 28, 29, 30, 33, 55, 214, 215}.0.0.0/8.

<li><p>Mirai <a href=""https://github.com/rosgos/Mirai-Source-Code/blob/master/mirai/bot/scanner.c#L200-L235"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">performs</a> a rather primitive <a href=""http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/SYN-scanning"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SYN scan</a> to try and find if any ports are open.

The attacker then waits in hope of receiving a SYN-ACK packet, which would confirm that the target is listening on the specified port. You can read more about the process <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Connection_establishment"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">on Wikipedia</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Mirai then <a href=""https://github.com/rosgos/Mirai-Source-Code/blob/master/mirai/bot/scanner.c#L449"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">monitors to check if its connection was successful</a></p></li>
<li><p>If the connection times out or something goes wrong, <a href=""https://github.com/rosgos/Mirai-Source-Code/blob/master/mirai/bot/scanner.c#L317"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mirai retries for a maximum of 10 attempts</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>If all of this succeeds, tough luck. Your device is now <strong>infected</strong> until it restarts!</p></li>

<p>Now, an intermediate node, between <strong>Node A</strong> and <strong>Node B</strong> breaks down, so the currently stored route becomes unusable.</p>

<p><em>What happens in this case?</em> I imagine that when <strong>Node A</strong> wants to send a message, it will travel all the way to the broken link where it will get stuck. The last node in the route will send back a message about the failure which will trigger a new Route Discovery by <strong>Node A</strong>, then a new route will be found and everything will alright again.</p>

<p>It is generally fine (given I was correct); the network recovers. But I am wondering if there are any algorithms or methods that provide a network monitoring feature which continuously checks the state of the links presented in the Routing Tables. So <strong>Node A</strong> can be notified about the failure before it wants to send another message to <strong>Node Z</strong>, and instead of running into a dead end, it can start with a Route Discovery at once.

  the request as the next hop address. No route reply will be generated.</p>
  
  <p>Many-to-one route request command is similar to unicast route request command with same command ID and

894,894,,,"<p>To understand better the power consumption of smart plugs it's worth peeking into them. To do so let's see some smart plug reference designs.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>One from <a href=""http://www.atmel.com/tools/smart-plug-reference-design.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Atmel</a></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pxok6.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pxok6.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p></li>
<li><p>One from <a href=""http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/tidu983/tidu983.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Texas Instruments</a></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dCzqB.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dCzqB.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p></li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see the parts of these two different designs are quite the same.</p>

<ul>
<li>There is an AC/DC power supply which provides the DC voltage for the sub-circuits.</li>
<li>There is a ""brain"", a Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller unit. The ATSAMW25 and the CC3200.</li>
<li>There are some dedicated hardware for power measurement.</li>
<li>A relay to be able to switch the mains lines.</li>
<li>Some feedback LED and buttons to interface the plug locally.</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically the power consumption of the plug itself is the total power consumption of these parts. The main consumers are the Wi-Fi enabled microcontrollers, the relays and I believe that the LEDs consume more than the metering parts. On the top of these comes the efficiency of the AC/DC power supply, there will be a certain amount of power loss on these elements.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller</strong></p>

<p>Most of the time the application processor will be in low-power mode with a current consumption between μA and mA. The Wi-Fi will add some more consumption, a couple of mA in its idle state.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/cc3200.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CC3200</a> for example consumes 12 mA if the application MCU is in Sleep mode (not deep sleep) and the Network Processor is in idle connected state. In case of RX the consumption rises to 56 mA and in case of TX to 270 mA maximum. (Detailed tables on page 32.)</p>

<p>Of course these parameters can vary for different devices from different manufacturers but roughly the scale is the same.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Relays</strong></p>

<p>There can be significant losses depending on the relay type. There is loss because of the coil, called coil power. This can be even hundreds of mW (<a href=""http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/2043478.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">10A, 240 VAC relay 500 - 700 mW coil power, cheapest on Farnell</a>).</p>

<p>And there is loss because of the contact resistance (100 mΩ for the previous relay, and with a 10 A load it dissipates some power). More expensive ones have better parameters, <a href=""http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/1514130.pdf?_ga=1.8666613.1331750453.1470678477"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">there are ones with 50 mΩ resistance</a> for example.</p>

<p>I am sure that the low cost knockoff plugs have cheaper relays so possibly consumes somewhat more.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>LEDs</strong></p>

<p>Worth noting the couple of mA, but nothing more.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AC/DC power supply</strong></p>

<p>This will add a percentage on the top of the overall consumption. Cheaper converters probably have lower efficiency, so a cheap plug would consume more in this case too.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ucc28910.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UCC28910 700V Flyback Switcher</a> from TI's design has a typical of 75% efficiency according to the datasheet (page 30.). There can be worse ones and few better. Again it gives a rough scale.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>All of these can vary of course but mainly these are the factors that determine the consumption of the device itself.
You could calculate a worst-case consumption for TI's design to get a W value. And of course you can check parameters of certain products.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Z-Wave Wireless Illumination Sensor with LCD Screen from Everspring activates programs or devices automatically based on illumination settings chosen in advance by the user. This sensor has a backlit LCD that displays a timer, illumination, transmission status and battery status. It has a lux (measurement relating to amount of visible light present) detecting range from 0 (darkness) to 3000 and a countdown timer that is adjustable from one minute up to eight hours. The sensor has a 60dB (decibel) built-in beeping tone/alert and has a wall-mountable design for use indoors or outdoors. The Z-Wave Wireless Illumination Sensor can be enrolled into any Z-Wave network to begin communicating with other Z-Wave enabled devices. It has an operating range up to 100 feet and is powered by three 1.5V AA batteries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, this device seems suitable because:</p>

<ul>
<li>it is rated for both indoor and outdoor use</li>
<li>it can detect from 0 - 3000 lux, so <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">although it won't detect bright sunlight</a>, it should be able to tell between overcast and sunny conditions</li>
<li>configurable lux settings so that you can reduce false positive detections.</li>
</ul>

899,899,,,"<p>It probably won't come as a surprise to you, but it doesn't seem like there are any pre-existing solutions which can link your devices together. However, since you said you were interested in custom-built solutions, you might be able to get close to what you want.</p>

<p>I did a bit of research into your devices to see if they had open APIs you could take advantage of. Unfortunately, not all the devices you listed are open - the Samsung Gear uses S Health, and I could only find APIs to <em>import</em> data into S Health, not get it back out into your own application. The Wahoo doesn't seem to have a simple web API, and nor does the Muse and Dexcom monitor. The rest of the devices <strong>do</strong> have nice APIs (which I've listed below).</p>

<h2>Data Sources</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://oauth.withings.com/api/doc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Withings API</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://dev.lumobodytech.com/docs/activities.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lumo API</a> </li>
<li><a href=""https://developer.underarmour.com/docs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Under Armour API</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Creating a Dashboard</h2>

<p>This really depends on your technical ability with programming. If you're not at all familiar with programming, your best bet would be some sort of spreadsheet software such as Excel or Google Sheets.</p>

<p>Google Sheets supports basic scripting, and <a href=""https://medium.com/@paulgambill/how-to-import-json-data-into-google-spreadsheets-in-less-than-5-minutes-a3fede1a014a#.knkb1smbc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">someone has developed a way to make JSON requests (the type of request needed to communicate with the APIs I listed)</a>. You could also read <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23917189/is-it-possible-to-send-http-request-from-inside-google-docs""><em>Is it possible to send HTTP request from inside Google docs?</em></a> on Stack Overflow for more context here.</p>

<p>Each API will have requirements on how to authenticate (for example, <a href=""http://oauth.withings.com/api"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Withings</a> uses OAuth), which you'll have to factor in when making your requests. It's probably worth spending some time getting familiar with the scripting needed to connect to these APIs (Google Apps uses JavaScript primarily); Google's <a href=""https://developers.google.com/apps-script/overview"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Overview of Google Apps Script</em></a> will probably help a lot here.</p>

<p>Once you get the data imported into your spreadsheet, it should be relatively straightforward to make a dashboard out of the data, and won't require much special knowledge. You'll also get complete design control for what you want to show, which is great, although it will obviously still be a spreadsheet.</p>

<p>If you need any more specific guidance, you can always ask a more specific question (programming questions can also be asked at <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/"">Stack Overflow</a>). Good luck!</p>

<p>In responses to your questions that you asked in an answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Assuming that I know a bit about programming, how realistic reverse engineering would be in making an API for the Gear, Muse and Dexcom monitor? What would be the simplest approach to do so?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably not particularly easy; I would contact the manufacturers (as suggested by Sean Houlihane in the comments).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any idea on how can I get similar results as above? Do I have to design the interface in Photoshop first and then create an HTML page to import my data from Google Sheet or AM I getting it wrong?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It depends on your approach. If you're able to design it in HTML, go ahead and do that, then use a framework like jQuery, Angular or ReactJS to connect your UI to the APIs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I might have misunderstood but it does not seem like Google Sheets nor Excel enable auto synch for the devices. It sounds like I have to enter the data manually...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's true, you would have to manually rerun the request in Google Sheets. If you used a HTML page like I mentioned in response to the last question, that wouldn't be a problem as data would have to be fetched new each time from the API.</p>

<p>You could either go the HTML route <strong>or</strong> the Google Sheets route; if you're able, the HTML method would work a lot better and give you more flexibility.</p>

900,900,,,"<p>A security camera would be the obvious example. if you want to do motion detection on the image (or face recognition), you have the choice of either streaming the video feed to the cloud, or processing it locally.

<p>The audio decoding of a smart home hub is another example. Certainly, the wake-word detection makes sense to perform at the hub (if only for privacy). Once the edge node has the processing capability required for voice control, maybe it makes sense to push that processing to the edge. For the service provider, this is a free gain - the node already needs a low-end linux capable platform, so why not make use of this resource rather than providing bandwidth and CPU in the cloud. Significantly, the bandwidth is likely to cost as much as the CPU in this context.</p>

<p>Even if the bandwidth load is reduced, an application may still be able to use edge computing and save cloud resource by making use of compute power which already exists in the edge node.

<p>Originally I have started the broker manually as follows:</p>

<pre><code>mosquitto -p 1883 -v

<p><code>-v</code> means verbose console logging. But this does not provide enough information, only the following line in case of my problem:</p>

<p>I have tried doing what is described in this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/13986313/3820025"">answer</a>. Here is the config file's logging part:</p>

<pre><code># Note that if the broker is running as a Windows service it will default to
# ""log_dest none"" and neither stdout nor stderr logging is available.
# Use ""log_dest none"" if you wish to disable logging.
log_dest stdout

# If using syslog logging (not on Windows), messages will be logged to the
# ""daemon"" facility by default. Use the log_facility option to choose which of
# local0 to local7 to log to instead. The option value should be an integer
# value, e.g. ""log_facility 5"" to use local5.
#log_facility

# Types of messages to log. Use multiple log_type lines for logging
# multiple types of messages.
# Possible types are: debug, error, warning, notice, information, 
# none, subscribe, unsubscribe, websockets, all.
# Note that debug type messages are for decoding the incoming/outgoing
# network packets. They are not logged in ""topics"".
log_type error
log_type warning
log_type notice
log_type information

# Change the websockets logging level. This is a global option, it is not
# possible to set per listener. This is an integer that is interpreted by
# libwebsockets as a bit mask for its lws_log_levels enum. See the
# libwebsockets documentation for more details. ""log_type websockets"" must also
# be enabled.
#websockets_log_level 0

# If set to true, client connection and disconnection messages will be included

<p>In this case I have started the broker as follows:</p>

903,903,,,"<p>Remember, you are <strong>always</strong> processing data at the edge, even if it's not obvious. The choice to sample data at a particular frequency, whether that is 1Hz or 100Khz (particularly with analogue data), is a form of edge processing. Very few scenarios will transmit data at the maximum clock cycle of the processor.</p>

<p>Some scenarios where explicit edge processing is useful</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bandwidth constraints</strong>. The often-quoted example is in the oil and gas industry where a lot of telemetry is gathered, and the bandwidth from the remote location is limited.</li>
<li><strong>Low latency requirement</strong>. Especially in control systems where something needs to happen in response to data. When sub-second responses mean the difference between normal operation and failure, a second or two round-trip to the cloud is unacceptable.</li>
<li><strong>Extremely low value of data</strong>. If nothing is likely to be gained from recording data, even in the future with sophisticated analytics, you might as well summarise and drop it at the edge. For example, mains power in the EU is expressed as 'nominally 230 V ±10% at 50Hz'. Given that you can handle that range, there is no point in transmitting the precise voltage every 100ms. If is better to transmit 'from this time to this time, the voltage was nominal'.</li>
<li><strong>Ordering of events is important</strong>. Devices have a narrower scope and can perform some derivations easier than the cloud. One of these is where the derivation requires that the data is in order. For example, it is easy on a device when measuring, say voltage, when it enters the on or off state. Timestamping the voltage measurement and sending it to the cloud makes the derivation harder as data may come out of order, delayed or be completely lost.</li>
<li><strong>As a failure mode</strong>. Connectivity to the cloud, or at least some of the processing, is likely to fail. All systems should be able to perform some edge-processing, even if it is dumbed-down, as a failure mode.</li>
<li><strong>Non-IP mesh</strong> The cloud will only be accessible via a gateway for non-IP devices, such as those that communicate over a low-power network or CAN bus-type wired connection. It may be preferable for devices communicate directly with each other in a 'mesh', in which case IP connectivity isn't needed, never mind cloud connectivity. Mesh is the holy grail of edge computing, but difficult to do.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy, trust, and regulatory issues</strong> Data can be collected that may be useful and valuable for analytics, but getting customer consent to collection and storage of the data may be difficult, and the cost and risk associated with managing access to the data may be too high. Facial recognition, and most image processing, is the obvious example. Another example is that all modern vehicles have GPS and connectivity built-in for emergency call response. Vehicle manufacturers and dealers could derive valuable insights from a stream of GPS data, but location data is personally identifiable in this scenario and shouldn't be collected, transmitted, processed and stored.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> We are aware that IoT is currently suffering from security issues. While it is possible to create a secure environment with cloud-connected devices, security is a major issue that needs to be actively worked on. Highly secure gateways, edge-based threat detection and other as-yet unknown defense mechanisms are going to be necessary in most environments.</li>
</ul>

<p>When considering material about edge processing, remember to consider the source. Existing IT vendors that haven't cracked the cloud market (IBM, HP, Cisco) are worried that IoT, as the next big thing, bypasses them altogether. As a result they will aggressively market edge processing. Indeed, 'fog computing' is a term created by Cisco to have a 'cloud' closer to the ground (or something). Obviously cloud vendors are marketing the reverse, for their own bottom line.</p>

905,905,,,"<p>Generally, you need a smart hub when some of your devices don't use Wi-Fi and can't communicate with your home network directly. Quite a lot of devices, especially sensors and actuators (like door locks and motors), use other protocols such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZigBee"">ZigBee</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-Wave"">Z-Wave</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth"">Bluetooth</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(network_protocol)"">Thread</a>, so they can't 'speak' directly with your Wi-Fi router. The hub acts as a <strong>translator</strong>, being able to communicate with both Wi-Fi networks and other protocols (almost always ZigBee and Z-Wave, but sometimes others too).</p>

<h2>What's the difference between Wi-Fi and these other protocols?</h2>

<p>Wi-Fi works well for applications where you're transmitting a <em>lot</em> of data, throughout your house. For example, if you're streaming a video across your house, you'll have no problems at all using Wi-Fi. But, <a href=""http://time.com/3745059/smart-home-wireless-networks/"">as explained by Time</a>, Wi-Fi isn't perfect for every use case:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Wi-Fi is a whole-home network,” says Chris Coley, principle engineer and architect with Logitech. Primarily used for media streaming, browsing the web, and other data-heavy activities, it’s a high-bandwidth network that’s power-intensive — just watch how fast your laptop battery dies when you’re watching a video on Netflix. </p>
  
  <p>Many smart home products eschew Wi-Fi-connectivity because it would require their devices to have a dedicated power source or a long-lasting battery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It'd be very costly if every networked device in your home used Wi-Fi, and your shiny new LED bulbs might use even more power than old, incandescent light bulbs, so devices like this turn to other protocols, such as ZigBee or Z-Wave. Philips Hue bulbs, for example, <a href=""https://www.developers.meethue.com/documentation/how-hue-works"">use ZigBee</a>, which is why the bridge is needed to 'translate' back to Wi-Fi so all the other devices can interface with it.</p>

<p>You can see how ZigBee and Bluetooth compare on page 51 of <a href=""http://eee.guc.edu.eg/Announcements/Comparaitive_Wireless_Standards.pdf""><em>A Comparative Study of Wireless Protocols: Bluetooth, UWB, ZigBee, and Wi-Fi</em></a>; in Figure 6, you can see that Wi-Fi consumes <strong>far</strong> less power per megabit. <em>So, why don't we use Wi-Fi for everything?</em> If you look at Figure 5, you can see that each Wi-Fi transmission uses far more power than ZigBee (Wi-Fi uses about 700mW, compared to ZigBee's power usage of less than 100mW).</p>

<p>For your light bulb, or thermostat, Wi-Fi doesn't make a lot of sense. If your device is just sending a few bytes worth of data (e.g. just a number), why waste loads of power on each transmission?</p>

<p><strong>In short: Wi-Fi makes sense when you're sending large amounts of data across long distances. Your devices probably don't need to do that, so other protocols make far more sense</strong>.</p>

<h2>What else do the hubs do?</h2>

<p>Some hubs, like <a href=""https://www.smartthings.com/uk/"">SmartThings</a>, can run pre-programmed routines ('automations') and allow you to customise their behaviour. Often, devices provide <a href=""http://docs.smartthings.com/en/latest/tools-and-ide/editor-and-simulator.html"">IDEs</a> or editors so that you can customise the rules. </p>

<p>You might be able to integrate with <a href=""https://ifttt.com/discover"">IFTTT</a> with some hubs (particularly <a href=""https://ifttt.com/wink_shortcuts"">Wink</a> and <a href=""https://ifttt.com/smartthings"">SmartThings</a>), which might be the simplest way of linking services together if you're not able to program using your hubs.</p>

<h2>Do I really need a hub?</h2>

<p>This really depends on your personal setup. If all of your devices use Wi-Fi, then no, it's probably not necessary. One <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/wiki/index#wiki_faq"">FAQ on Reddit</a> has a concise explanation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A close parallel can be drawn between a hub and a standard Wi-Fi router. In simple terms, both are boxes with radios and a little bit of smartness. Eventually, hubs and Wi-Fi routers may merge into one product (indeed, the Almond line of routers from Securify already do this), but currently most households will need to buy a hub because no other device in the house has the requisite radios to talk to the various switches and sensors. In addition, the hub must remain in the house so that automation can continue even when no person is there. This allows for presence simulation in “vacation mode” or pre-heating or pre-cooling the house before arrival.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In effect: <strong>lots of hubs don't just 'translate', they can also perform some processing and automate things that the manufacturer didn't provide by default.</strong> If you want the flexibility of customising how your devices work and interact, a hub is a great idea. If you're just planning to have a voice assistant (like a Google Home or Amazon Echo) and want to fetch the weather, there's probably no need just yet.</p>

<p>To figure out <em>which</em> hub you should pick, consider the following points:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Which protocols do your devices use?</strong><br>
You should be able to search for hubs which are compatible with a specific protocol. For example, when I searched for ""Z-Wave hubs"", I found <a href=""http://buildyoursmarthome.co/reviews/best-z-wave-controller/"">this list of products</a>, so you can get some additional guidance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do your devices list specific integrations with a hub?</strong><br>
For example, the ecobee3 specifically lists SmartThings and Wink as compatible; you should factor this into your decision.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Does the hub you're looking at allow you to automate things simply?</strong><br>
Some hubs may use a programming language you're unfamiliar with. It's probably best to avoid them, otherwise you're stuck with a device you can't control! </p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>So, if that was all too much to read:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Bridges generally just 'translate' from one protocol to another, and tend to only work with one device or manufacturer (e.g. the Hue bridge).</p></li>
<li><p>Hubs can both translate and run automation routines themselves, allowing your devices to interact in a more complex way.</p></li>
<li><p>For anything more complex than a trivial setup, you probably need a hub. Make sure you research to find out which one suits you!</p></li>

907,907,,,"<p>Technically, different devices will communicate using protocols that are not internet-based, protocols that are proprietary, and tied together with different administration tools.</p>

<p>The reality is, particularly in consumer IoT, that you are witnessing an important battle between vendors that have an interest in dominating the consumer IoT (or home automation) market. Vendors of chipsets will promote their chosen radio network, vendors of products will promote their management tools, and others will position themselves as the one hub to rule them all. People, and minnow tech companies, fed up with this try and promote standards, which often get co-opted by major players. You will see this where every 'standard' has an 'alliance' page, which is the source of their ability to produce a standard. </p>

<p>There is no single 'hub', as there is no single vendor. People need to commit to an ecosystem (or two) and hope for the best.

912,912,968.0,2.0,"<p>I have used MQTT to connect all my ESP8266 units but I have a general question regarding topics. According to <a href=""http://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-essentials-part-5-mqtt-topics-best-practices"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">www.hivemq.com</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>""Leading forward slash"" <code>/</code> should be avoided.</li>
<li>Spaces should be avoided.</li>
<li>Use only ASCII characters.</li>
<li>Embed a unique identifier or the ClientId into the topic.</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have pretty much applied to this but I use some special characters (% and ° for example). For example I use:</p>

<p><code>Garage_Sensor_001/Temperature/°C</code> <code>value</code></p>

<p><code>Livingroom_HID_002/Switch_001/Action</code> <code>value</code></p>

<p><code>Bedroom_Sensor_001/Motion_001/Detection</code> <code>value</code></p>

<p>I.e.</p>

<p><code>PLACEMENT_OF_NODE/TYPE_OF_SENSOR_UNIT_OR_ACTION/FUNDAMENTAL_UNIT_OF_VALUE_IF_ANY</code></p>

<p>So my question is: <strong>Should I use special characters when naming MQTT topics?</strong></p>

<p>Let's turn it another way: <strong>how does your implementation programming language manage special chars? Spaces? Accents?</strong> ... Especially when you split them, hence the ""no forward slash"" rule.</p>

<p>If you have a perfect control on UTF-8/ASCII codepages (trust me, you don't) then go ahead! Put accents, specials chars!</p>

<p>Then think of the following, and this applies to all projects: </p>

<ul>
<li>Evolutivity: who will take care of your project? You? An open-source community? Keep it simple for anybody (even you) to not have to type complex/long topic names.</li>

914,914,,,"<p>Goufalite is entirely correct about this problem: it's not a technical issue at all, just a naming problem, so a lot of the advice is very opinionated based on the author's idea of what names are best.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.html#_Toc398718109"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MQTT 3.1 specification says</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Topic Names and Topic Filters are case sensitive</li>
  <li>Topic Names and Topic Filters can include the space character</li>
  <li>Topic Names and Topic Filters are UTF-8 encoded strings, they MUST NOT encode to more than 65535 bytes</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>So, purely speaking on technical grounds, the ASCII-only and 'no spaces' rules are not necessary; all compliant MQTT brokers should be able to handle them just fine.</p>

<p>I don't really agree with some of the points HiveMQ make anyway:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A space is the natural enemy of each programmer, they often make it much harder to read and debug topics, when things are not going the way, they should be. So similar to the first one, only because something is allowed doesn’t mean it should be used. UTF-8 knows many different white space types, it’s pretty obvious that such uncommon characters should be avoided.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's highly unlikely you're going to be using spaces any other way than just pressing the <kbd>SPACE</kbd> key on your keyboard, so I don't think accidental usage of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoglyph"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">homoglyphs</a> is really going to be a problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using non-ASCII UTF-8 character makes it really hard to find typos or issues related to the character set, because often they can not be displayed correctly. Unless it is really necessary we recommend avoid using non ASCII character in a topic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fair point - typing non-ASCII characters can be a big problem. Personally, I would avoid <code>Garage_Sensor_001/Temperature/°C</code> simply because a lot of keyboards don't have a degrees symbol built-in (British keyboards certainly don't!). This decision is really based on practicality rather than due to the protocol; if you are able to use special characters without much fuss, and you're certain that no-one else will need to type the characters in, go for it!</p>

<p>Also, I'd be a little sceptical about some of HiveMQ's advice; further on in the page you linked, it says ""Don't subscribe to #"", which <a href=""http://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/334/don-t-subscribe-to-so-how-to-dump-all-messages-to-database-with-mosquitto"">has already been disputed on the site</a>!</p>

<p>If this is what you are looking for I don't know but someone else might like the solution provided here. To break the command line down:</p>

<p><code>C:\Program Files\mosquitto&gt;</code> is the local folder for Mosquitto</p>

<p><code>mosquitto_sub</code> is the .exe file used to listen to the broker</p>

<p><code>-t +/#</code> ""-t"" is to give the .exe file the information to listen to <strong>t</strong>opic of <strong>+/#</strong> which is all topics from clients. ""#"" would mean all topics, even broker created topics. <strong>\$SYS/#</strong> will only listen to broker topics. It is possible to have multiple -t (I think).</p>

<p><code>-v</code> is to give the .exe file the information to output the topics verbose, i.e. also output the topic itself (not only it's value).</p>

<p><code>|</code> is to pipe this first command into the script command.</p>

<p><code>cscript //nologo timestampLog.vbs</code> is to execute cscript.exe with the vbs script that we previously wrote.  <code>//nologo</code> is telling the command line prompt to output the cscript.exe output information into a external file instead of the prompt itself.</p>

<p><code>2&gt;</code> is telling the command line prompt to output ""StdErr"" (which is what we told the script to funnel all messages to in the .vbs file).</p>

<p><code>C:\*USER*\Desktop\logfile.txt</code> is the path and file name of the output. Instead of .txt you might consider using .log or something else.</p>

918,918,,,"<p>I will proceed to answer your first question.</p>

<p>If you want to just learn I can recommend you some books about IoT but I guess you can search them by yourself. If that is clear, then I would recommend you to start working on your own small project, that is how you learn the best, facing real-life problems. </p>

<p>You will need to decide what is what you want to create.
Here are some inspiration and cool ideas to start off:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Projects/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Arduino Projects</a> -> Microcontroller</p>

<p><a href=""https://diyhacking.com/best-raspberry-pi-iot-project/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Raspberry Pi projects</a> -> Microprocessor (more powerful)</p>

<p><a href=""http://hackaday.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hackaday.com</a> -> Mixed components</p>

<p>Once you have the idea of what you want to do, then you need to come up with requirements for your project. The microcontroller, sensors, actuators, communication protocols, etc.</p>

<p>As you can see the most popular devices are <a href=""https://www.arduino.cc/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Arduino</a>, <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Raspberrypi</a> and all the other relatives, <a href=""https://beagleboard.org/black"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">beaglebone black</a>, <a href=""https://onion.io/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">onion</a> , etc,
There are many more, the differences are the price, the compatibility with other sensors and the popularity. The popular ones are more compatible and have more support on forums.</p>

<p>We cam help you out with the requirement based on your project. 
Good luck!</p>

919,919,,,"<p>This is a very broad question, but I will try to give a few general pointers, hopefully useful to others, as well as you (so, please accept my apologies if I post things which you already know).</p>

<p>If you are asking about reading sensors, this is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">telemetry</a> and not necessarily IoT. I have coded many projects where a standalone PC reads &amp; displays some measurement.</p>

<p>If you also want to controller the attached hardware, this is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SCADA</a>. Again, it need not necessarily be connected to the internet.</p>

<p>Here's a diagram of SCADA, whcih gives avery good feel for the IoT in general. Note that the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PLC</a>s on the diagram are sensors and controls of IoT enabled devices.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BBfp3.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BBfp3.png"" alt=""SCADA architecture""></a></p>

<p>You can ask for hardware commendations for sensors &amp; controller at <a href=""http://hardwarerecs.stackexchange.com/"">Hardware Recommendations</a>.</p>

<p>And, once you have some code, you can get advice for problems at <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/"">Stack Overflow</a>.</p>

<p>Generally, IoT for industry involves the client/server model, with the client measuring/controlling hardware devices and reporting to/receiving commands from the server. The server also generally has a database, and allows for generation of reports for management and alarms (and may instruct the remote hardware to reconfigure/shutdown based on data received).</p>

<p>Phew! That’s the intro out of the way. Now to get our hands dirty.</p>

<p>If you want to get into the nitty gritty of coding, look at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sockets</a>, and understand the difference between <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TCP</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UDP</a>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the decades have wrapped most of the trickier stuff in libraries, and you are probably best advised to read up on RESTful services.  There are numerous free online tutorials, courses and videos, depending on your language; C is a traditional embedded language, with some using C++, but of course, use whatever you know/feel comfortable with. Python is hugely popular and simple to learn, as well as being the recommended language for the Raspberry Pi. </p>

<p>Personally, I prefer compiled languages to interpreted, as it is easier to get the bugs out, but the choice is entirely up to you. Just make sure that it has good support for accessing peripherals over USB, Ethernet and - still extremely common in industry – serial port.</p>

<p>For the server side, 90%+ of the world’s server are still running on PHP. However, there is an uptake on use of NodeJS, mainly from people who code browser apps, which currently can only be done in JavaScript and don’t want to learn two languages. I don’t recommend developing browser based IoT apps, because of the restrictions on browser code accessing the file system and peripherals (although, I would mention the likes of <a href=""https://cordova.apache.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cordova</a>, if you want to develop for smartphone).</p>

<p>To get started, I would recommend a <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Raspberry Pi</a> (coding in Python or C).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z3816.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z3816.jpg"" alt=""Raspberry Pi board""></a></p>

<p>And I <strong>* highly*</strong> recommend a sensor hat. <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B014HDG74S"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This one</a> is just an example, but it is not expensive and  contains    </p>

<ul>
<li>Gyroscope – angular rate sensor: +/-245/500/2000dps Accelerometer   </li>
<li>Linear acceleration sensor: +/-2/4/8/16 g   </li>
<li>Magnetometer - Magnetic Sensor: +/- 4/8/12/16   </li>
<li>Gauss Barometer: 260 – 1260 hPa absolute range (accuracy depends on the temperature and pressure, +/- 0.1 hPa under normal conditions)   </li>
<li>Temperature sensor (Temperature accurate to +/- 2 degC in the 0-65 degC range)   </li>
<li>Relative Humidity sensor (accurate to +/- 4.5% in the 20-80%rH range, accurate to +/- 0.5 degC in 15-40 degC range)    </li>
<li>8x8 RGB LED matrix display   </li>
<li>Small 5 button joystick</li>
</ul>

<p>That will allow you gather some data and report it to your server. You might be able to find a free service online to receive and display your data. I have seen some on other S.O site, but forget where.</p>

<p>But, you probably want to code your won server. I would recommend PHP as programming language. For Linux, you are well provided with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LAMP</a> (Linux, Apache, Mysql &amp; PHP). For Windows, you have to install a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29#WAMP"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WAMP</a> (Windows … etc). </p>

<p>You can take your pick. I have used <a href=""https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">XAMPP</a> in industrial applications for over a decade. You don’t <strong><em>have</em></strong> to use Mysql, Sqlite can serve just as well (shaless plug for my own S.O question of 6 years ago, “<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4813890/sqlite-or-mysql-how-to-decide""><strong>Sqlite or MySql? How to decide?</strong></a>“). You will also have to learn about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CRUD</a>.</p>

<p>Based on the data received from the client/sensor, you might want to send a command back, even just a simple (display : ""temperature too high"", which might translate to closing a valve in an industrial system).</p>

<p>You might want to raise alarms in real time (send email saying that the temperature is too high).</p>

<p>And, you might also want to think about generating reports. Start with a table showing data  received. The consider a chart, or something fancier. Add an option to export to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Comma Separated Values</a> (CSV) which allows the end user to import the data into a spreadsheet for further analysis and manipulation.</p>

<p>If you <strong><em>do</em></strong> decide that you want fancy reporting, you <strong><em>can</em></strong> do it in PHP, but, after a few decades of that I have now moved to doing much of the report stuff client side, in the browser. </p>

<p>For generally principles, get an overview of  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Single Page Application</a>s and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AJAX</a>. I, personally, did a lot of research and chose Google’s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AngularJS</a> as my programming language (there are lots of <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_intro.asp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tutorials</a> &amp; great support), but you are free to use plain JS, Jquery, etc, as you please.  </p>

<p>If you do decide to code browser stuff too, and you might be as well to use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NodeJs</a> on the server side, so that you only have to learn one new programing language.</p>

<p>Too many choices? Sorry :-(</p>

<p>I hope that this has given you some advice, but feel free to ask questions, and let me know if there is any general advice missing here.</p>

923,923,,,"<p>As an experienced developer you have the ability to understand logic, read and write code, figure things out, and some other important skills. What you probably don't have is an understanding of basic electronics and the art of getting code from your desktop running on a small device.</p>

<p>Jumping in at the wrong level of complexity can be daunting, and may mean that you give up too soon. For example, people recommend the ESP8266 and NodeMCU without thinking that you need to get the right one, you need the chip mounted on a development board, you have to get your software on it, you need to wire it up to something, and only then are you able to run JavaScript. That is a lot of different skills that you need, and you could give up on any one of those stages.</p>

<p>My recommendation is to start with an Arduino. Where Arduino made a difference in the maker community was how easy it is to plug an Arduino in a USB port, and the compile, build, deploy chain is all sorted for you. You can write some code, and flash some LEDs very quickly.</p>

<p>I also suggest that you start with the official <a href=""https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoStarterKit"" rel=""noreferrer"">Arduino starter kit</a>. While it is very simple, the instructions are easy and you get a bunch of useful electronic bits and pieces (breadboard, jumper wires, LEDs, etc) that remain useful.</p>

<p>Don't be put off by how basic the Arduino is. Get some enthusiasm going first for the electronics and hands-on part before trying anything too complex. If you find the electronics interesting and want to do more, stick with the Arduino and get a more complex kit. I bought the <a href=""http://learn.parallax.com/tutorials/robot/shield-bot/robotics-board-education-shield-arduino"" rel=""noreferrer"">BOE Shield-Bot robot</a>. It may not be the best or cheapest robot, but has a really good tutorial that goes into detail on how to controls servos and such. You also land up with a whole lot more useful bits.</p>

<p>If you get through that, you'll either give up and get back to server-side software, or you will buy more bits, soldering irons, more boards and components. Very soon you'll land up with a drawer of broken dreams like the rest of us.</p>

<p>I wouldn't recommend using the Pi too soon. It's more of a computer than a thing, and doesn't have important features that are necessary in the beginning of your journey of understanding (like analogue input). You'll very quickly outgrow the Arduino (it doesn't connect to the Internet very easily), but it's a good place to see whether this will be something that you enjoy.</p>

924,924,,,"<p>Others have focused on the first facet of your question; I'm going to focus on the latter.  You asked if just anyone can get into IoT or if you have to be a big company with many resources.</p>

925,925,,,"<p>Great question!  As has been remarked in the comments, this sounds mostly like a news report rant that hasn't really researched completely.  All the articles out there say essentially the same thing: no new research has been done to confirm suspicions, and all articles find their source (eventually) in a <a href=""https://www.abiresearch.com/press/nest-cam-works-around-clock/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">single article by abiresearch.com</a>.  That article in and of itself is lacking; as @jterrace suggested, it would be very simple to just test data transmission.  However, none of these tests have been done.</p>

<p>In other words, just from a surface glance, it looks not like an absolute scam, but like an insufficiently tested hypothesis which can't truly be proven from the information given.  Furthermore, I ran into a few articles like <a href=""https://www.slashgear.com/no-nest-cam-isnt-secretly-spying-on-you-25416086/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one from SlashGear.com</a>, which examines ABI's claims.</p>

<p>These articles point out that ABI has yet to explain why they feel that the current <em>ought</em> to drop when the camera is off.  We tend to think of it something like a DVD machine or TV screen that turns on in response to Infra Red, but in reality, the Nest Cam functions nothing like the same.</p>

<p>A TV only needs to have a small portion of its system booted up.  However, the Cam <em>must</em> have the <strong>whole system</strong> booted up, so as to be able to receive information over the network (drawing electricity) and start the camera as quickly as possible (which is estimated to take <a href=""https://www.slashgear.com/no-nest-cam-isnt-secretly-spying-on-you-25416086/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">45-60 seconds</a> from cold boot).</p>

<p>The current staying at 340mA is not unusual: the camera must keep itself booted up and listening to the router.  And according to their spokesman:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When Nest Cam is turned off from the user interface (UI), it does not fully power down, as we expect the camera to be turned on again at any point in time.  With that said, when Nest Cam is turned off, it completely stops transmitting video to the cloud, meaning it no longer observes its surroundings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the answer is, <strong>no, as far as we can tell, the Nest Cam is <em>not</em> recording you when it's off.</strong></p>

932,932,,,"<h2>Option 1</h2>

<p>One solution I have seen and I could recommend is to divide your warehouse in areas and create gateways for accessing to them with the forklift or trucks. Then you setup the antennas on those gateways and force the drives to pass through them in order to track the goods movement. 
Basically it is the same logic behind any shop store with those RFID antennas at the entrance scanning people going in and out, that triggers the alarm as soon as they read a tag that was not killed.
The antennas should be powerful enough to scan a whole pallet or even a truck. Additionally you should also consider the type of RFID tag you will use.</p>

<p>[Updated]</p>

<h2>Option 2</h2>

<p>Consider the case where the forklifts are the only that move the palets around the warehouse, why not setting the RFID antenna to them.
Adding a geolocation sensor you can know exactly where the palet was stored and if you add a gyroscope you could even know the height of the rack.
A step further could be to add a weight sensor to the forklift to detect when the palet is picked up and when is drop, plus the palet's weight to calculate the accumulated load of rack.</p>

933,933,,,"<p>Although it's not ideal, you could use two IFTTT recipes to allow you to call your phone: one to set the ringtone volume to maximum, and one to actually call the phone. It's a little more involved than I'd like, but since IFTTT offers no chaining of actions, it's the best you'll get.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>IoT devices go beyond inter-device communication. Take for example a TV remote, it is an embedded device which communicates with the TV through an infrared signal to instruct the TV to do something like change channels. Would you consider this an IoT device?</p>

<p>IoT devices 'go beyond' by: </p>

<ul>
<li>Allowing more automation in the home.</li>
<li>Collecting, storing and aggregating large amounts of data into information that is useful to the user and easy to understand.</li>
<li>Allowing users to access information and control devices from inside the home, and even from the outside via the internet.</li>
</ul>

<p>These features could be fully implemented in your product and without cloud services, it's more a case of deciding if the features you want your IoT product to have would benefit from cloud infrastructure. The benefits come in different areas:</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Data</strong></h2>

<p>Data can be kept on the cloud instead of including a storage media on device. This has many benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cost effective - Pay only for the storage needed, on device storage will add a fixed cost per device and 100% utilisation is unlikely.</li>
<li>Flexible - Storage can be increased when needed. On device storage is fixed and will limit the amount of data a device can hold. You could create a device that lets the user provide a storage media like an SD card, this however adds another decision the customer has to make about what card to purchase for their needs and this complexity may deter some customers from buying the product.</li>
<li>Redundancy - Cloud storage is typically sold with redundancy measures included, meaning that data is backed up and is very unlikely to be lost.</li>
<li>Centralised - If your IoT device is one which customers may buy multiple of, data can be brought together on the cloud to provide a more uniform experience.</li>
<li>Access to data - If the data is retained on a cloud service, you as the product provider can access that data. This is useful to see how consumers use your product and can shape improvements in your products. </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Software Services</h2>

<p>It's likely that your IoT devices will have an aspect of interaction with the user through software. By utilising the cloud your products software could benefit from:</p>

<ul>
<li>Automatic updates - If you are continually developing new features for your product, using the cloud can ease the distribution of firmware updates. Devices could query the cloud for updates automatically, taking this task away from the user. This could be especially useful if you discover a security issue with your product, being able to push an patch to all existing devices will avoid the issue of some customers not updating their devices manually. Preventing your devices from being hacked and used for malicious purposes will prevent you from receiving bad publicity.</li>
<li>Web technology - Web applications are built on the idea that users may access the application from a different range of devices, all with differing operating systems and screen resolutions. As web apps are accessed through internet browsers the user doesn't need to install software on their own devices, users can simply go to a link and login to access their IoT interface. Customers can receive new features in their software interface without having to go through the task to update the software on each of their devices. Hosting this interface online also reduces the hardware requirements of the device and thus unit cost.</li>
<li>Features - Some cloud services could be implemented in your product to enhance its features, for example Amazon Lex is available as a cloud service which can be used to enable a user to use voice commands to interact with your device. </li>

944,944,,,"<p>While you can design an IoT gadget to work via direct connection with the user's phone, a device that only works in that manner may be too limiting for many users:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the user is not at home, then they are unlikely to be able to interact with the device directly, as allowing inbound connection attempts to the home network is generally unacceptable from a security standpoint, and most mobile carriers also block inbound connection attempts to the phone.  Instead, out-of-home requests need to be proxied through a server reached by outbound connections from both the phone and the IoT device.</p></li>
<li><p>If the user is at home, but their phone is presently on a mobile network rather than their home network, then the above issue still applies.  Asking the user to switch their phone from mobile to wifi may or may not be acceptable to different users and depends to some degree on their phone's wifi battery usage; also some phones choose between both dynamically in a way that may be problematic if you require the wifi network.</p></li>
<li><p>Connection between the phone and device by some other method like BTLE can be an advantage, but is range limited so may not work in all parts of the home or surrounding property, and obviously will not work when away from home.</p></li>

I find it bit expensive for the amount of units I need.</p>

<p>Here is one <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00KT50HK4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">example</a> from Amazon.</p>

<ul>
<li>This solves my power requirements by taking the power directly from the power net.</li>
<li>Provides communication over Wifi.</li>
<li>I can connect any microcontroller with a power adapter to it.</li>
<li>Since it is commercial Hardware I believe that it will provide some safety level of operation, in comparison to a testing board I could do on my own, I woun't like to set the kitchen on file because a silly short cut.</li>

952,952,,,"<h2>A little bit of context</h2>

<p>Since you're using MQTT with AWS IoT, <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/identity-in-iot.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">you're expected to use X.509 certificates</a> for authentication and security. Amazon have <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/x509-certs.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a little bit of guidance</a> about how you should secure your certificates, so I'll quote that here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Certificates enable asymmetric keys to be used with devices. This means you can burn private keys into secure storage on a device without ever allowing the sensitive cryptographic material to leave the device.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since you're currently using the STM32's <a href=""http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/application_note/b4/14/62/81/18/57/48/05/DM00075930.pdf/files/DM00075930.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.DM00075930.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Read Out Protection</a> (RDP), all but the most determined attackers will have trouble accessing your certificates in your current scheme:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The global Read Out Protection allows the embedded firmware code (preloaded in the Flash memory) to protect against reverse engineering, dumping using debug tools or other means of intrusive attack.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Level 0 - No protection (default)</li>
  <li>Level 1 - Flash memory is protected against reading by debugging or code dumping
  by the RAM loaded code</li>
  <li>Level 2 - All debug features are disabled</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h2>Is external storage going to be secure?</h2>

<p><strong>It probably isn't <em>as</em> secure</strong>. If your client's private key is stolen, an attacker can send data that appears to be from your device, when it actually isn't. Although it's not clear what data you're sending, any untrusted data can be a security risk.</p>

<h2>Which bits do I need to keep private?</h2>

<p>When you create a device certificate on AWS IoT, you should see an image like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/images/certificate-created.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/images/certificate-created.png"" alt=""AWS IoT""></a></p>

<p>The private key is the thing you really need to keep... <em>private</em>, and should definitely be stored on the read-protected memory if possible. The public key and certificate are designed to be shared, so if you're running out of space, you can safely move those to external storage. You can get a little bit more context on the page <a href=""http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/20803/how-does-ssl-tls-work""><em>How does SSL/TLS work?</em></a> at Information Security Stack Exchange and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Public-key cryptography</em></a> on Wikipedia. I think I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't include this image to explain <em>why</em> the private key needs to be secret:</p>

<p>Your device's <strong>public key</strong> is what AWS IoT uses to sign messages to send to your device (but it <strong>does not prove who is sending the message</strong>). So, really, it's not a huge disaster if someone steals the public key, because it's not meant to be a secret.</p>

<p>The <strong>private key</strong> is what your device uses to decrypt messages, so it's a slightly bigger problem if an attacker steals this.</p>

<p>You also asked what would happen if the attacker stole the RootCA certificate. If someone stole <strong>AWS IoT's private key</strong>, it would be disastrous, but the RootCA certificate on your device <strong>isn't that</strong>. The <code>RootCA.crt</code> that Amazon give you is <a href=""https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/verisign/roots/VeriSign-Class%203-Public-Primary-Certification-Authority-G5.pem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">completely public</a>, and the purpose is so that you can verify that you're not being attacked in any way (most likely a man-in-the-middle pretending to be AWS IoT's servers).</p>

<h2>What damage could a hacked device do?</h2>

<p>Your stolen device can only perform the actions listed <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/attach-iot-policy.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">in the policy</a>. Try to follow the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">principle of least privilege</a>; only grant your device the privileges it <strong>absolutely needs</strong>, so if the worst does happen, it can't wreak havoc too much. For your specific case:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The thing is allowed to publish to only 2 channels (its name and a data feed channel) which is connected to a data processor which will ignore any rogue packets coming to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's good. Any attack should be isolated to just the two MQTT topics that the device can publish to, so it won't cause large scale harm.</p>

The server public key, and the AWS public certificate are important to secure at the device end not because you want to keep then secret, but because by replacing the AWS certificate (on a compromised device) an attacker can persuade the device to carry out an exchange with the attacker's host, or to man-in-the-middle your communications to AWS.</p>

955,955,,,"<p>You mention “certificates”, but from context, I think you're referring to two different things.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Your device has a <em>private</em> key, which is unique to this device and not known outside the device. This key identifies your device. Anybody who can access that key can impersonate the device. That means that they can, in particular:</p>

<ul>
<li>Publish valid, but incorrect data on the channels that your device is legitimately authorized to publish to.</li>
<li>Publish invalid data that will get the legitimate device banned.</li>
<li>Possibly, depending on the use case, expose some private information of the owner of the device.</li>
</ul>

<p>This private key had better remain confidential.</p></li>
<li><p>Your device probably has at least one <em>public</em> key, which allow it to recognize which servers it's talking to. It's ok if anybody can read this key: it's public. But an attacker should not be able to modify the key. Otherwise, they could communicate with the device and impersonate the server. This could allow them to do things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Push a firmware update to the device.</li>
<li>Push a configuration update to the device.</li>
<li>Make the device upload its data to a different location.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The good news is that this threat analysis is actually not very relevant. <strong>You do not need to sacrifice any security</strong>! (At least not confidentiality and authenticity properties — if you store stuff externally, then availability takes a hit, because that's one piece of the system that could go missing.)</p>

<p>As long as you have at least 128 bits of storage that you can write to at least once, which you have and more, you can implement a secure remote storage solution. Use the limited-space on-device storage to store a secret key. This secret key must be unique per device; the STM32 has a hardware RNG, so you can generate it on the device during first boot. If your device didn't have a hardware RNG, you could generate the key in a secure off-device location and inject it onto the device.</p>

<p>With this key, use <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">authenticated encryption</a></strong> for things that you store off the device. When you want to read some data from external storage, load it, decrypt-and-verify it. When you want to write some data to external storage, encrypt-and-sign it. This guarantees that the data is as confidential and authentic as the data in the internal storage.</p>

<p>Authenticated encryption is enough to guarantee the confidentiality and <em>authenticity</em> of the data, but it doesn't quite guarantee its <em>integrity</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>If there's more than one chunk of data, then when the device reads back a chunk of data, it can't be sure that this is the correct chunk. Solution: include a unique identifier in the content of each chunk (e.g. start each chunk with one of <code>""AWS-IoT private key.""</code>, <code>""configuration CA certificate.""</code>, <code>""publishing server CA certificate.""</code>, <code>""user personal data.""</code>, …).</li>
<li>If you update the data at some point, then when you read it back, you can't be sure that you're getting the latest version of that data. If someone can modify the external storage, they can't put fake data because that would fail the authenticity check, but they can restore old data, because what used to be authentic is still authentic. Solution: in each data chunk that is stored externally, include a counter which you increment each time you write a new version of that chunk. When you read a chunk back, verify that it's the expected version.</li>
</ul>

<p>To avoid bricking a device in case the external storage is damaged or otherwise lost, in the limited space you have space on internal storage, you should give priority to whatever is needed to reset the device to a “good” state, e.g. a factory reset. The second priority will be performance considerations.</p>

956,956,,,"<p>Do you need to? You can implement a cryptographically secure random generator if you have two things: some rewritable secure storage, and an initial seed. That is, it's enough to seed the RNG once, and then save its state and work off the saved state. It isn't ideal, it would be better to mix in entropy periodically, but it's ok, especially for a development protoype.</p>

<p>You do need to have rewritable secure storage. If the device only has ROM and non-secure storage, then this approach is not possible. There must be a location where you can store the RNG state in such a way that your adversaries can neither read it nor modify it.</p>

<p>The way this works is, when the device boots, it loads the current RNG state, and uses it to generate some enough random bytes for twice the size of the RNG state. Write the first half as the new saved RNG state, and use the second half as the initial RNG state for the current session. With any cryptographically secure PRNG, this yields a cryptographically secure PRNG.

965,965,1023.0,1.0,"<p>I've been reading about the Roost Smart Battery.  Essentially, it's a battery you can install in your smoke detector which is supposed to notify you on your phone if your smoke detector goes off.  It also gives you the capability of silencing your smoke detector from your phone.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-smart-smoke-alarm/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Wire Cutter</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...Roost will automatically notify someone else about the alarm in your home when it’s triggered, without giving that person control over all your other smart-home devices (as is the case with Nest’s version of this feature). But unlike the [Nest] Protect, the Smart Battery doesn’t give you voice alerts, wireless interconnectivity, integrations with smart-home devices, or self-testing sensors [...]</p>

<p>According to my understand (maybe flawed) of the word interconnectivity, it means something along the lines of this definition from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Interconnectivity refers to the state or quality of being connected together, or to the potential to connect in an easy and effective way</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the Smart Battery is not in the state of being connected together with your phone, how would they communicate?  There is obviously a flawed premise.

966,966,,,"<p>From the context, I believe it is referring to interconnectivity <strong>with other alarms in the house</strong>. From earlier in the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most important, an alarm should connect wirelessly with other alarms in the home, or come in a hardwired version that you can wire to other alarms, so that when one alarm senses danger all alarms in the house will sound. This is a crucial safety feature that can save you precious seconds in evacuating your home. Also, many states now require interconnected alarms for new construction, so if you do a significant remodel in your home, you don’t want to end up having to buy a different brand of alarm for the new area (most brands don’t play well with one another when it comes to interconnected alerts).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The author of that article seems to use  <em>interconnected</em> to refer to the alarms connecting together so that they all sound together in case of a fire. The Roost Smart Battery does not do this, because it just works by listening to detect your alarm going off with a piezoelectric sensor, <a href=""http://www.techhive.com/article/3004024/home-tech/roost-smart-battery-review-this-is-the-best-smoke-alarm-battery-you-can-buy.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">according to TechHive</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The detector relies on the high-pitched sound of the alarm to deform a piezo-electric sensor to trigger its own alarm. I intentionally installed the battery in the smoke detector in my master bedroom because its siren is defective—it makes more of a growl than a high-pitched squeal. But the Roost still went into an alarm state, perhaps after picking up the noise of the detector in the hallway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your smoke alarm is still 'dumb' and can't share its state with other alarms, and the smart battery has no way of causing your alarm to trigger, either.</p>

<p>A 6LoWPAN to 3G gateway is probably a bit of an esoteric use case - any you can find will be built-in to an end product, so it might be cheaper to assemble a unit from modules (or re-purpose an old phone maybe depending on the scenario).</p>

<p>Just to elaborate on the 'how' part, it seems to be common now for these radio interfaces to be integrated with a reasonably powerful MCU which handles the communication stack. Not just the link-layer, but some of the security aspects of the protocol too. So this would easily be able to interface to a GSM module through a UART, without needing a further processing device. Building the radio stand-alone would actually be harder than having it tightly integrated with a control processor.

  <p>Abstract - 
  There has been considerable interest in energy harvesting
  for wireless sensor networks. Energy harvesting from thermal
  sources such as body heat and mechanical sources such
  as human motion have been proposed. There are also sensor
  network systems that harvest energy from the visible part of
  the electromagnetic spectrum. However, ambient light levels
  in indoor environments are typically significantly lower
  than those found outdoors and highly dependent on the nature
  of the indoor environment considered. Recently, lowpower
  clock synchronization using electromagnetic energy
  radiating from AC power lines was proposed. In this paper,
  we go a step ahead and try to answer the question: Can energy
  be harvested from the electromagnetic energy radiating
  from AC power lines and use it to operate a wireless sensor
  network with a low duty-cycle? We find that such energy
  harvesting appears promising.</p>

990,990,,,"<p>This is an idea I've had that I'll throw out here...</p>

<p>It seems like it should be possible to have a small device that you simply wrap a mains power cord around a few times (or wrap the device around the power cord, I'm not sure which). When the ""host"" device is powered on and current is flowing, the ""parasite"" on the power cord would become powered--not much, obviously. But, perhaps enough to periodically send a wireless ""ping"" with an ID (like a MAC address) to some receiver. What this would get you is a sensor that would tell you whenever ""dumb"" devices were switched on. Based on the frequency of the pings, you might even be able to infer how much power the dumb device was using.</p>

<p>Since the mechanism would be simple and inexpensive, and require no regulatory approval for plugging into mains power (UL/CE etc.) possibly someone could sell these in packs for a target price of ~$5 each. When you get enough of them (which would be the point to have a lot), a machine learning system could learn things about your habits: The hair dryer is on, it's probably ~30 minutes to bedtime. The coffee machine is on, turn on the radio...that sort of thing. And you don't have to buy a smart hair dryer or coffee machine that costs 30-40 times as much as a $5 sensor just to get that usage data.</p>

993,993,,,"<p>This is an unusual use-case where the data throughput which you require is really low - range and low power are the driving factors. This points in the direction of a low data-rate, narrow band protocol (or maybe one using a spreading code, such as GPS).</p>

994,994,1052.0,1.0,"<p>I'm having a but of trouble making sure my project really is feasible.</p>

<p>What I want to archive:
Control my Senseo coffee machine via internet. It boils down to simply controlling 2 buttons.</p>

<p>First easy solution:</p>

<ol>
<li>Setup a NodeJS server on my Raspberry Pi.</li>
<li>I plug my Raspberry GPIOs to 2 transistors, to control the coffee machine buttons</li>
<li>I can control the Raspberry GPIO directly in Javascript. For example calling <a href=""http://myraspberrypi.com/makemeacoffee"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://myraspberrypi.com/makemeacoffee</a> activates the GPIO, activates the buttons, and the coffee flows</li>
</ol>

<p>But: <strong>I don't want to plug my raspberry to my coffee machine</strong> (I need the Pi for other purposes), and I think that decoupling the web server and the controller itself is a good idea. If tomorrow I want to monitor the temperature of my bathroom, or control a second coffee machine (using another ESP8266) I want be able to do it without rethinking the whole thing.</p>

<p>What I need to archive that is an ESP8266 with NodeMCU to use it as a Wi-Fi headless controller (see <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/ESP8266-Web-Server-Without-Arduino/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""this link"">this link</a>). Raspberry GPIO are no longer used (that's the point). There is only a NodeJS web server on the Pi.</p>

<p>Here is a quick sketch of the architecture: 
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qHkhc.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qHkhc.png"" alt=""is this architecture feasible ?""></a></p>

<p>Let me clarify the role of the main components: </p>

<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi: Hosts the NodeJS web server</li>
<li>NodeJS web server: Serves the web pages to the end user. Basically a page with a button ""Make me a coffee"". Behind the scene, we need to ""push"" the heat up the water button, wait 30 sec, then ""push"" the coffee button. The web server does so by sending HTTP requests to the  ESP8266 (over Wi-Fi). The NodeJS server also does logging and data analysis (how many coffee did you drink this year ?)</li>
<li>ESP8266: Uses NodeMCU. Its GPIOs are plugged to a transistor controlling the coffee machine buttons. I don't care about how to power the ESP8266. It runs a web server to listen to the Raspberry Pi requests and do actions on GPIOs accordingly.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Is this architecture feasible?
Is this architecture flexible?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT, to answer Sean Houlihane (spoiler to keep the post relatively short):</p>

<p>I'm not 100% sure about this, but a transistor is seems to be enough. The coffee machine switch is working on low voltage (3,3V) and the ESP8266 won't share the ground with the coffee machine.</p>

<p>About the temperature sensing, and the water level control, the Senseo coffee machine has this built-in. 
Typical use : Press the center button to launch the heat up process, choose your coffee size by pressing the ""single"" or ""double"" button. Once the heat up process ends, the coffee starts flowing. If there is not enough water, it ends and a LED blinks.</p>

<p>The progress I expect : </p>

<ul>
<li>Version 1.0 will be ""Just run the coffee machine, I am sure it's  ready"". I control the single cup button and the heat up button.</li>
<li><p>Version 2.0 will be ""Run the machine and give me feedback"" I had another ESP8266, plugged to the feedback LED (So that I can know when it's heating up and when it's out of water) and another one to a scale to make sure the cup is there before running the coffee machine. I might also add an alert when the coffee machine is ran to tell the user to change the pod.</p></li>
<li><p>Version 3.0 will be to find a way to tell if the pod has been changed, by tracking the opening of the mechanism with some kind of switch. But this is out of the scope of my project at the moment.</p></li>

996,996,,,"<p>This is a great idea to harvest energy from our daily energy use. But you have to consider that the energy you harvest comes from somewhere.

1001,1001,,,"<p>First of all, I should say that XML has been used for encapsulating realtime messages with some success, and at large scale, in particular for communicating IM and presence in XMPP. There also seem to be some companies that are intent on leveraging their XML knowledge to try to find yet another application area for this data representation system.</p>

<p>However, not everyone is convinced that XML is the answer to everything in messaging systems. For example, there's been a noticeable shift in recent years to online systems that use JSON as a way to serialize data rather than XML, and if I put my developer hat on for a moment I would say that the tools to encode/decode from native representation (e.g. in Python, PHP, Javascript) seem a lot easier to use than for JSON than their equivalents for XML, even if XML has had more time to get those answers right. </p>

<p>XML is a difficult representation for computers to handle, as it needs a relatively complex text parser, and then some kind of hierarchical representation to allow its data to be extracted in a program. Because there's so much text involved, you need quite a bit of memory available for encoding/decoding. </p>

<p>Often it seems unclear that XML is adding much value to the representation of the data: if the core message is not deeply hierarchical, then adding a lot of textual chaff seems unnecessary, but paradoxically if there is a lot of hierarchy then decoding the message from its textual representation is going to be hard work and need a lot of resources. Also, the benefit of representing in text are not clear to me: When we first write and debug communication systems it is common to use monitoring/decoding tools (for example Wireshark) to help us to figure out what is going wrong. In the long term, everything is working fine, and no human will need to look in detail at the messages going back and forth (only computers). Computers prefer binary representation. The textual representation benefits no-one involved at any stage of deployment.</p>

<p>XML is hard for humans to read (and manually construct) while being hard work for computers at the same time; It is therefore a system that is neither suitable for computers and nor is it suitable for humans.</p>

<p>Importantly, IoT has some special constraints that make it desirable to be efficient.  IoT devices will typically have limited processing power and storage (usually no large scale secondary storage, only some RAM and EEPROM). An IoT device might have the simplest possible communication links, maybe not even a TCP/IP stack. There will be a wide variety of microcontroller designs, not even at the level of sophistication where a standard operating system (e.g. Linux, Android) would be in use; this limits the number of off-the-shelf tools that will be lying around offering easy XML interfaces to use.</p>

<p>In summary, I suspect that with IoT, data representation is better left on a case-by-case basis, depending on hardware constraints, style of communication (e.g. broadcast, datagram, reliable etc), frequency of communication and so on. XML certainly shouldn't be thought of as a <em>sine qua non</em> for IoT.</p>

Plus, if a car is already parked in my garage (like my wife's car), the door won't open. There is obviously safety-issue there (like a door giving access to my house when no one in front of it), but I do not want to deal with this right now.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help of for any idea you can give!</p>

1005,1005,,,"<p>While having so much valuable answers to my question I have also done some further research about the topic.</p>

<p>I have found an additional harvesting solution and also a great reference design about a wireless, solar energy powered sensor node, without using a battery. </p>

<hr>

<p>First the additional method from Texas Instruments, which is called <a href=""https://training.ti.com/how-harvest-energy-nano-power-dcdc-solutions"" rel=""noreferrer"">RF switch harvesting technique</a>. (The video is worth watching, the RF switch part starts at 2:29.) It is based on a magnetic switch which structure can be seen on the image below.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MqMn7.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MqMn7.png"" alt=""RF Switch harvesting model""></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the drawing here in the red is the switch part the user will push. We have a magnet inside with the two poles. And this is creating a magnet field through this core back to the other pole.</p>
  
  <p>When the user flips the switch, you can see the field changes. It goes the opposite direction through the core. And we know from Maxwell's equations that this change in magnetic field through these windings will produce a current. This is energy that we can harvest and make use of.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The switch produces an AC current that needs to be converted to DC current which can charge a capacitor. Then the energy stored in the capacitor can be used to power a low-power wireless MCU.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ifkSU.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ifkSU.png"" alt=""remote switch - power solution curves and flow""></a></p>

<p>TI has actually realized this and they were able to supply enough energy for 21 milliseconds for the wireless MCU.</p>

1006,1006,,,"<p>As noted by Sean Houlihane <a href=""http://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/1060/automatically-open-a-garage-door-when-approaching-by-car#comment1723_1060"">in a comment</a>, you're looking for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo-fence"" rel=""noreferrer"">geo-fencing</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A geo-fence is a virtual perimeter for a real-world geographic area. [...] The use of a geo-fence is called geo-fencing, and one example of usage involves a location-aware device of a location-based service (LBS) user entering or exiting a geo-fence. This activity could trigger an alert to the device's user as well as messaging to the geo-fence operator. This info, which could contain the location of the device, could be sent to a mobile telephone or an email account.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are various ways that you can implement this, depending on what sort of device you use and how much code you're willing to write:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://www.howtogeek.com/221555/how-to-create-geographic-event-triggers-with-your-smartphone-and-ifttt/"" rel=""noreferrer"">How-To Geek</a> has an article on how to use geo-fencing with IFTTT. You could then connect that to something like the Maker channel, which can send POST requests to your garage door.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://developer.android.com/training/location/geofencing.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Android also provides a geo-fencing API</a> which you could use if you were so inclined. This would be far more involved than using IFTTT, though.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, this answer neglects the other side of the question: how do you make the garage door open when it receives a message? That aspect would probably be best addressed in a different question, but if you used the IFTTT Maker channel to send a request, you would need to have some sort of networking capability on the device that opens the door. Your current door opener is probably not that advanced if it just uses an infrared detector, so custom hardware might be needed.</p>

1008,1008,,,"<p>The problem is essentially one of receivers and of power. </p>

<p>A ""find my keys"" type of beacon needs to be small enough to attach to your keychain and you probably don't want to have to regularly recharge the beacon (you wouldn't lose your keys if they're always in their charger) so that requires either:</p>

<ul>
<li>a passive technology without a battery.</li>
<li>an active technology running of a battery that is extremely power efficient and doesn't require recharging/battery replacement for months or preferably years. </li>
</ul>

<p>Then you also need a receiver to locate the beacon and in the case of a passive technology you also need a transmitter to power and activate the beacon. The options for receivers/transmitters are either:</p>

<ul>
<li>a dedicated and/or proprietary receiver unit, which allows the manufacturer to select optimised frequencies, protocols and technologies, but which means you need to bring out that receiver when you need to find your keys.</li>
<li>use the smartphone which you already carry as the receiver. That makes the solution a lot cheaper, you only have to buy beacons, but also limits the beacon manufacturer to technologies, frequencies and protocols that are commonly implemented on smartphones.  </li>
</ul>

<p>The advantage of <strong>passive beacons</strong> is that they're likely to be quite reliable and cheap to manufacture, the expense is in a transmitter/receiver combo that works from a reasonable distance. Most likely you'll need special purpose device to take the role of tranmitter/receiver as smartphones currently only support  NFC as a passively powered protocol,  <strong>near</strong>-field communication with a range of a couple of cm.<br>
An example that works over significant distances would be the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RECCO"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Recco</a> beacons and receivers marketed for finding people buried by avalanches. </p>

<p>For <strong>active beacons</strong> the main issue is power consumption. As you listed there are a number of different protocols and solutions that are low powered and energy efficient, but since nobody really seems to want to depend on separate receivers but would rather use a smartphone effectively that means either Bluetooth or WiFi.<br>
 As currently phones can only be connected to one WiFi network at the time and when operating as a hotspot can't be connected to another WiFI network at all, that is probably not the most desirable protocol.<br>
With Bluetooth 4 and above on the other hand  a large number of devices can be connected simultaneously and that standard also comes with the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_low_energy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bluetooth low energy</a> variant. You also get a reasonable distance from Bluetooth. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So should we stay on BT beacons or can other protocols be more reliable especially for home usage?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>In summary:</strong> unless you are willing to use a specific receiver to find your beacon Bluetooth Low Energy is the best choice.  </p>

</ul>

<p>It should be relatively easy to extend with extra sensors or modules; there are plenty of <a href=""https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/hats"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HATs</a> available, and if you need to create something specifically for your device, you can <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/physical-computing-guide/connect-leds/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">take advantage of the GPIO pins and a breadboard</a>.</p>

1019,1019,,,"<p>Key here is the datasheet as linked in <a href=""http://iot.stackexchange.com/a/1068/54"">Jimmy Westberg's answer</a>. The sensor will output: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The  4-20  mA  vibration   transmitters  are  piezo-electric  accelerometers  of  compression  type   and provide  a   4-20 mA output  signal  proportional to the true RMS value of vibration velocity. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the output of this sensor is a <strong>current</strong> signal between 4 mA and 20 mA (<strong>not</strong> a voltage) that is proportional to the RMS value of vibration velocity. To read this sensors output the current will have to be converted to a voltage using a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transimpedance_amplifier"" rel=""noreferrer"">transimpedance amplifier</a> (current-to-voltage converter) or measuring the voltage drop acros a well defined series resistor.</p>

<p>However as the sensor output is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square"" rel=""noreferrer"">true RMS</a> value of vibrations in the specified frequency range (2..10,000 Hz) it is not possible to obtain the frequency (or to be more precise the wide frequency band) of the vibration with this sensor. To detect the frequency spectrum a measurement of the time waveform of the vibration amplitudes would be necessary.</p>

<p>This <a href=""https://www.bksv.com/media/doc/br0094.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">booklet about vibration measurement</a> gives some more insight.</p>

<p>The RMS value is typically used in quantifying the vibration level:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The    RMS   value   is   the   most   relevant   measure   of   amplitude   because   it   both   takes   the   time   history   of   the   wave   into   account   and   gives   an   amplitude   value   which   is   directly    related    to    the    energy    content,    and    therefore    the destructive abilities of  the vibration. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The purpose of this sensor seems to be for monitoring of machinery where the actual time waveform of the vibration is of little interest. A single value (the RMS value) is sufficient to monitor the operation of the machine against a threshold value. It significantly simplifies measurement.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Experience   has   shown   that   the   overall   RMS   value   of   vibration   velocity   measured   over   the   range   10   to   1000   Hz gives   the   best   indication   of   a   vibration's   severity.   A probable    explanation    is    that    a    given    velocity    level    corresponds   to   a   given   energy   level   so   that   vibration   at   low and   high   frequencies   are   equally   weighted   from   a vibration    energy    point    of    view.

1034,1034,,,"<p>Baile, I think that we are missing a fine distinction here.</p>

<p>When you speak of a Posix like standard for IoT, I think that you are speaking of libraries which wrap a protocol.</p>

<p>As one who has been employed for (<em>cough</em>) decades implementing protocol stacks for telephony and satellite communication, I can say (as you are probably aware) that these protocols are, by need, already strictly defined.  For instance, Zigbee is governed by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4</a></p>

<p>These standards lay down the messages to be transmitted and define that byte 0 means this, bytes 1 through 4 mean that, etc, so that devices from disparate manufactures can communicate with each other (that’s the theory, anyway; I could tell you some horror stories ;-)</p>

<p>As I said, for any given protocol, there can be a plethora of manufactures. And for any given manufacturer, there can be multiple software libraries, which is your problem.</p>

<p>Your task is too difficult as long as there are multiple APIS available, which wrap each protocol. </p>

<p>Sadly, there will only be a Posix-like API only if one company becomes dominant. There might be a thin possibility if a major government throws a lot of money at it, but I can’t see that happening. The only other chance I as Linux-like effort by the Open Source community.</p>

<hr>

<p>Btw, I don’t think that you make it clear enough that your will not be just another static code analyser, that it is not intended for general code, but for certain specific APIs. You do say that, sort of, but not explicitly enough, IMO. When you define that exactly, you will know what your project really is.  If you already know, you don’t seem to emphasize it (but maybe I am not reading well enough, rushed between two meetings).</p>

<p>The syntax of POSIX APIs is policed by the compiler, as will be the syntax of any APIs which you study. So I guess that you are looking for potentially dangerous code , such as use of unitiatlized resources, not freeing allocated resources, etc – is that correct?</p>

<p>It sounds like a great project, though, and I have starred this question.</p>

1038,1038,,3.0,"<p>This is a subject I have been thinking of for a while, especially because the ""IoT"" concept has been floating around a lot lately.</p>

<p>I will start with what I mean when I say <strong>""IoT""</strong>. I know that the term IoT could mean different things and that sometimes it's misused. It could be a term that is not clearly defined and can lead to big discussions around what does it exactly mean, I myself don't know the proper and widely accepted definition of the term. <strong>So for me IoT is a concept, a concept that defines the ability to connect to an embedded device remotely through the internet either from another embedded device or from a cell phone</strong>. As simple as that.</p>

<p><strong><em>On this context, the purpose of the connection doesn't matter, if you can connect one device in your office with another one at home, or if you can connect to one device at home from your cell phone, all this through the internet, then we are talking about IoT devices</em></strong> (the embedded devices, not the phone).</p>

<p>So, having agreed on what I mean by IoT I will now describe what I'm trying to achieve.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to achieve is precisely that what I describe on my definition of IoT.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>I want to have one or several embedded devices at home connected to my internet router, either by ethernet or wifi and be able to connect to them remotely with another embedded devices in a remote location (and by remote I mean not on the same network) and maybe also to be able to connect to them with a monitoring app on my phone</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, I may have a simple embedded device acting as an on/off switch hooked op to my garage door opener and another embedded device acting as a big red button on my desk at work so that I can push the red button in my desk and the garage door opens.</p>

<p>Another example would be to have an embedded device with ADC capabilities that can monitor the temperature of my house and send me an alert when it reaches a threshold. The notification could be received either by a simple android app or by another embedded device with a little screen sitting on my desk at work.</p>

<p>These examples may be silly but are just to illustrate the possible scenarios and use cases for what I'm trying to achieve. At the end, the idea is the same, connect one embedded device with another through the internet.</p>

<p><em>Another thing to clarify is that the data exchange between these devices will be very lightweight, just a couple of bytes every time, it is not that hundreds of kilobytes are needed to be interchanged between devices.</em></p>

<p><strong>Additionally, the kind of ""embedded devices"" I'm referring to are simple but capable devices based on 100MHz or 200MHz cortex-m4 microcontrollers. And that is important to clarify because there won't be any Linux or complex libraries running on those devices. In the end, is such a waste of resources and completely unnecessary to have a powerful processor running Linux just to turn on and off a light bulb</strong>. In any case, I'm planning to use a BeagleBoard, Raspberry Pi, or any other board like that as my embedded devices. Just Microcontrollers because no more complexity than that is needed.</p>

<p>I don't know much about IoT platforms and those kinds of complex solutions out there. When I started this journey of finding out a way of connecting one embedded device with another through the internet I stumbled upon a couple of sites with IoT services.</p>

<p>I know that there are some IoT cloud services like:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/167134865/blynk-build-an-app-for-your-arduino-project-in-5-m"" rel=""noreferrer"">Blynk</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://cloud.google.com/solutions/iot/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Google Cloud Platform</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://exosite.com/platform/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Exosite IoT Platform</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://www.aylanetworks.com/products"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ayla IoT Platform</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Just to name a few. The main issues with those are cost and complexity. You have to pay to get those services and also you have to learn how to implement all the services they have, in case you need them all, and their APIs and maybe a bunch of other stuff that doesn't seem necessary to me to be able just to interchange some bytes between devices. I just want something simpler than that, something I can do myself.</p>

<p>You may say that implementing my own ""cloud"", if that is something I have to do, is not simple and sometimes is better to use those kinds of services for the sake of simplicity but there are two main reasons I want to know how to implement my own IoT services.</p>

<p>The main reason is that I want to do it myself. I don't want to rely on a 3rd party to connect my devices to each other and since I'll be developing the code and the hardware for my devices then it feels better to also create my own means to connect them as IoT devices.</p>

<p>The second reason is to learn how to do it. By knowing all the necessary things I need to achieve this, I will have a better understanding about the IoT world.</p>

<p>Also, I want to mention that I'm proficient in C and I use Linux as my everyday OS at work as well as in my home, so please avoid windows stuff because that is useless to me. I'm not afraid of anything I have to implement in C for my embedded devices or on Linux to implement whatever is needed to achieve my goal.</p>

<p>So my question is, <strong>what is it necessary to implement, and where, to be able to connect two or more embedded devices to each other with the purpose of data interchange between them?</strong></p>

<p>This question <a href=""http://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/756/what-can-i-use-to-create-an-iot-on-our-own-server"">What can I use to create an IoT on our own server?</a> have something similar but is closed and doesn't have any answers, also assumes an already existing cloud infrastructure to be used. So it doesn't help me.</p>

1039,1039,,,"<p>Maybe I missed the point of the question, but I think this is a good start at an answer.</p>

<p>You need three things, at a minimum.</p>

<ol>
<li>An always-on compute node to aggregate your data. This does not need to be powerful, It could be a process running on your NAS, or even (in theory) on your router. For simplicity, assume it is a Raspberry Pi. This could also provide any fancy radio protocols that you decide to support in the future. Although in theory you could run peer-to-peer with all nodes exposed to the internet, it is easier to nominate one as the master and have this handle the data collation and publishing (to the app/user). Of course, the hub can be a node too, particularly if you use WiFi nodes which are moderately powerful.</li>
<li>A suitable software stack to allow the endpoints to submit their data to your hub node. <a href=""/questions/tagged/mqtt"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;mqtt&#39;"" rel=""tag"">mqtt</a> is the sort of thing you need here, plus an OS to run it on.</li>
<li>DNS and port-forwarding to facilitate access to your server from the wider internet.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then don't forget security. By doing this, you will be closer to opening up everything on your home network to attack. Maybe only a little bit, but it's good to be aware of the risk. You can try and take care, but do assume you will make mistakes.</p>

1041,1041,,,"<p>You've questioned both previous answers about the need for a controller/hub. Consider that to make things happen, you need rules to exist. If you want to push a big red button to open a garage door, some rule has to tie the sensor (button) to the desired action (opening the door). There are two ways to make that happen: you can put the rule directly in the button, or you can put the rule in a separate computer.</p>

<p>Let's think more about the direct solution. If you teach the button about the garage door, then your button holds the rules internally.  The button needs the ID of the garage door, so if you replace the garage door, the button doesn't work.  If the button is on your desk, and your house uses a proprietary network, the button has to know both the address of your home's gateway and the address of the door.  The button needs to know the specific protocol to signal your door to open - do all manufacturers make compatible buttons that know about all door signals?  The button can't do anything else unless you reprogram it - do you have a flash programmer for the button's chip laying around, and is that programmer compatible with any other devices?  If you want the garage door to open, and 5 minutes later close, your button needs all the complexities of maintaining a real-time clock.  Your button won't know the state of the door, making it hard to know if you're closing the door or opening it.  And how do you back up the rules so that if your button breaks, your replacement button can do the job?  On the plus side, it sounds cheap: you don't need a separate computer.  </p>

<p>With a controller, things are different. All messages from all sensors are delivered to the controller.  Each sensor is simple: send the signal to the controller.  The controller can then apply whatever inputs are needed to very complex rules: it can check the sunshine sensor and not turn on the outdoor lights unless it's dark, or not run the sprinklers if the average rainfall for the month is above average and the current temperature is five degrees below average.  The controller can keep track of state.  This could be important if you want a ""close garage door"" button but not an ""open garage door"" button (when I'm away from home, I rarely want to open the door, but I definitely want to close it if it is accidentally left open.)  </p>

<p>The controller can provide the place for device drivers that know how to listen to buttons and other drivers that know how to speak to doors.  The controller may be more upgradeable to new devices and device types than a tiny chip tucked inside a button.  </p>

<p>The controller can also have more complex logic for infrastructure tasks such as delivering messages by offering certain levels of service.  For example, the MQTT protocol allows for three different levels: try to deliver the message once, deliver it repeatedly until it's been seen at least once, or deliver it once and only once.</p>

<p>The controller offers an architecturally logical place to consolidate all messaging to and from a communication gateway, allowing the use of an external interface.  This means your button and your phone can both send signals, and the rules can figure out that either one is allowed to open the garage door.  The gateway can also provide the security.  You don't have to put your button and your garage door on the internet; you can put them both on private isolated networks and use the gateway to carry the signals.  The controller also provides a single point to back up all the rules for your system.  </p>

<p>The downsides to the controller are added latency and extra complexity.  Surprisingly, a controller doesn't make the cost go up appreciably.  You can implement a controller on a Raspberry Pi for less than the cost of one average remotely controllable light switch.  Don't discount the idea on the basis of cost alone.</p>

<ul>
<li>what about a smart temperature management? You can set up some heat sensor in various places, then connect them to a central server. Then, find a way to know when your heating device(s) is(are) on, and make your system learn how the temperature where sensors are reacts to heater on/off. Now, you can save your habits into your server (wake-up at 7am, leaving for work at 8:30, going back at 5pm etc...) and set each temperature you want when present/absent. The ultimate goal is to make your system start heating just when needed, to wake-up in a comfy environment at 7am and let the house getting cold when absent, etc... You may need to find a way for your server to activate each heating device</li>
<li>in addition to smart heating, you can set up automatic shutter opening and closing. Winter time? Open the shutter when sun is up to heat your house for free, and close them when sunset to not let any degree get away <em>via</em> your windows. Summer time? Reverse the principe: protect from external heat at day, ...</li>
<li>you can set up smart access to your home too, like an <a href=""http://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/1060/automatically-open-a-garage-door-when-approaching-by-car"">automatic garage door</a></li>
<li>and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>To do so, you may have to:</p>

<ol>
<li>set up a server</li>
<li>create a link between it and every sensor/actuator in your house</li>
<li>create a client to monitor your house (temperature efficiency, time with shutters closed/open, etc...)</li>
<li>imagine algorithms for the smart heating part and for shutter commands (and internet requests for sunrise/sunset time)</li>
<li>make statistics and every data you want</li>

1048,1048,,,"<p>Building upon several years of deploying outdoor wireless sensor networks, I would like to add the following hint:</p>

<p><strong>Think ahead and do not underestimate the problems arising from humidity!</strong></p>

<p>I will answer your question by providing some pitfalls with humidity in outdoor devices. However, please consider these <a href=""http://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/1115/what-should-be-considered-when-building-a-wireless-sensor-network/1116#1116"">general guidelines when planning a wireless sensor network</a>.</p>

<p>It is very simple to build a housing that keeps the rain from falling onto your sensor, but as @Ghanima pointed out it very much depends on what you really want to measure.</p>

<p>However, the main problem is not rain but humidity. This is roughly what happens with not properly constructed devices in outdoor environments, starting with a dry housing:</p>

<ol>
<li>The outdoor temperature rises. The temperature of the air in your device rises even more (especially when placed in the sun).</li>
<li>Therefore, the air pressure in your device rises, it expands and some part diffuses out of the device.</li>
<li>The temperature falls. Thus humid (!) air diffuses back into the device. </li>
<li>The humid air condensates inside the device.</li>
<li>The cycle repeats, but the temperature inside the device is not high enough to evaporate the water again. Therefore, water accumulates inside the device. Every day a very tiny amount of water is added.</li>
</ol>

<p>Several possible approaches to counteract this problem:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sealing the device</strong> Trust me, that does not work with household items. Even if your freezer box has a seal and silicone works good in the bathroom, both do not prevent the flow of humid air! Dipping the device into water without any water coming in, does not mean that humid air will stay out, too! If you want to go that way, buy industrial grade (IP rated) housings and do not drill additional holes into it!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Drilling a hole into the bottom</strong> What, you just said the opposite? The reason is simple: If you can not avoid that humid air comes into your device, you should at least avoid that water accumulates inside. For many electronic components <em>some</em> humidity is not such a big problem, but accumulating water is!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Air-conditioning</strong> Heating up the device prevents condensation. This is the common approach for large and sensitive outdoor devices, especially if the condensation itself induces problems (for example for optics).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A pressure-compensating diaphragm</strong> Not that cheap but works quite good in practice by equalizing the air pressures. There are also cable feed-throughs with an integrated diaphragm.</p></li>

1050,1050,,,"<p>Please do not waste your time and make the same mistake as hundreds of research groups (including ours) made before for decades and just throw some unspecific sensors into the wild without knowing what you really want to get in the end!</p>

<p>There is a nice paper from 2006 (!) that shares experiences from a real-world deployment.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Be prepared for those and many other problems that could arise and <strong>plan ahead and focus on your target!</strong></p>

<p>You should ask yourself the following question: Why do I want to build the deployment? Is it really the data itself that I want to collect, do I want to evaluate and develop network protocols or do I want to develop and test new hardware? The answer results in very distinct paths:</p>

<h3>I want to get the data!</h3>

<p>In that case, try to rely on proven practices as much as you can. Buy standard hardware, use industrial grade housings, provide much more batteries than you think your hardware requires and monitor them! Use already existing and well-tested software and do not build everything from scratch! Even think about the following: Do I <strong><em>really</em></strong> need wireless connections?</p>

<p>Of course, there are many applications where you really need hundreds of energy harvesting, wireless, self-organizing and tiny devices. But just using these techniques because they are <em>cool</em> is a waste of money and time.</p>

<p>If you really want to get the data, nothing is more frustrating than to notice that just for the most interesting day, no data is available because water has accumulated in your devices (been there...).</p>

<h3>I want to improve protocols for wireless sensor networks!</h3>

<p>In that case, really focus on the core. I talk about network protocols here, but it equally holds for all other procedures and algorithms in the IoT context.</p>

<p>For most protocols, it does not care if they transport real-world data or just some pseudo-random noise. So why not take the easy road, throw away your sensors and just generate some random data? I recommend the following procedure:</p>

<ol>
<li>Think about which problem you want to solve. What is your research question?</li>
<li>Read! Many things have been done already. Many concepts have been shown to be good, many others not. Starting with network protocols from scratch is just a waste of time.</li>
<li>Do some theoretical evaluations. Is it really possible to improve a given protocol or is it already at a principle boundary? Shannon can not be fooled!</li>
<li>Do simulations. I suggest the OMNeT++/INET framework, but there are many frameworks out there. But please do not start from scratch. Most components are already there for your convenience. Test if your ideas work in the controlled environment of a simulator.</li>
<li>Work on the hardware implementation. Does your implementation work at least on your desk?</li>
<li>Test it in an already existing testbed. One example is the <a href=""https://www.iot-lab.info/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FIT IoT-LAB</a>. This allows you to test your implementation with real-world hardware without the burden of all the problems arising from self-made testbeds.</li>
<li>Now you can finally plan your real-world deployment and tailor it to the specific problem that you want to address. Until now you should have a good idea how dense your network has to be, how many devices are meaningful, how they should be distributed, which kind of data has to be provided and so on. Then go to ""I want to get the data!"", but this time your data is the performance measure that you want to test.</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes, this is a long way to go, but there are students doing this during a  six-month master's thesis, so it is feasible and definitely worth the effort! There is already so much existing research in this area that skipping a step does not pay off in the end.</p>

<h3>I want to build cool hardware!</h3>

<p>If you are mostly interested in building cool hardware, start with playing around with existing hardware. Then think about what this hardware lacks and what could be improved. Maybe you just want to create a nice and <a href=""http://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/1085/temperature-sensors-affected-by-rain/1114#1114"">waterproof housing</a> and see how it works in practice.</p>

<p>You will need several iterations anyway, so start with something oversized (e.g. in terms of RAM or persistent memory) and then strip away unnecessary parts in future iterations. This is much more satisfactory than recognizing that the software you want to use is just 1 KB too large after production.
Also, provide good possibilities to debug and evaluate your hardware.</p>

<p>Even if you do not need a serial or USB interface for the final application, it speeds up the development a lot. If you are actually building a housing, attach a humidity sensor and monitor it constantly instead of just waiting and checking manually. If you integrate an energy harvester, monitor the energy flows, even if a precise power measurement IC might be oversized for a final application.</p>

<p>For the software part, rely on existing components! If you are building a testbed because you like to build hardware and you do not really know what to do with it, publish it! There are many people (see above) that dream to have access to a real-world deployment, so they will happily provide software.</p>

start with playing around with existing hardware Then think about what this hardware lacks and what could be improved Maybe you just want to create a nice and waterproof housing and see how it works in practice You will need several iterations anyway so start with something oversized eg in terms of RAM or persistent memory and then strip away unnecessary parts in future iterations This is much more satisfactory than recognizing that the software you want to use is just 1 KB too large after production Also provide good possibilities to debug and evaluate your hardware Even if you do not need a serial or USB interface for the final application it speeds up the development a lot If you are actually building a housing attach a humidity sensor and monitor it constantly instead of just waiting and checking manually If you integrate an energy harvester monitor the energy flows even if a precise power measurement IC might be oversized for a final application For the software part rely on existing components If you are building a testbed because you like to build hardware and you do not really know what to do with it publish it There are many people see above that dream to have access to a realworld deployment so they will happily provide software

<p><em>I created this as a separate question because it would be difficult to properly to follow-up just with comments on all the answers, someone could get kind of lost. Also, this information may be useful for somebody with a similar question.</em></p>

<p>I don't like the idea of having to go to my router configuration and configure the port forwarding because that means that  I have to configure a device that in spite of being part of the IoT infrastructure, is not one of ""my"" devices. It has to be as less disruptive of the already existing home network as possible. Also, I've had instances where I don't know the admin password of a particular router and it has been really difficult to get it.</p>

<p>I'm sure that there is a way around that even if that means having a more powerful IoT HUB maybe running Linux, I just don't know what that could be. It is OK to have a bit more complex HUB if that ""alternate"" way allows avoiding that port forwarding configuration.</p>

<p>I say that I'm sure there is a way thinking about how applications like team viewer don't need to configure port forwarding.</p>

<p>So the question is, <strong>does anyone know a way of ""exposing"" an IoT embedded device to the external internet in order to access it from anywhere in the world that does not involve port forwarding?</strong></p>

1052,1052,,,"<p>If you can't port forward your router, you might have to resort to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_punching_(networking)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>hole punching</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hole punching is a technique in computer networking for establishing a direct connection between two parties in which one or both are behind firewalls or behind routers that use network address translation (NAT). To punch a hole, each client connects to an unrestricted third-party server that temporarily stores external and internal address and port information for each client. The server then relays each client's information to the other, and using that information each client tries to establish direct connection; as a result of the connections using valid port numbers, restrictive firewalls or routers accept and forward the incoming packets on each side.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NAT</a> on your router means that clients outside of your network can't connect to open ports of devices <em>inside</em> your network, but it doesn't restrict devices in your network from connecting to a 'broker'. Using <a href=""http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/udp-hole-punching/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a little bit of indirection</a>, you can establish a direct connection between two devices without actually opening any ports - this is essentially what services like Skype and Hamachi do.</p>

<p>Of course, this does require an external server to co-ordinate the connection, and you would probably want to trust the server that was performing the hole punching.</p>

I think it would be useful to ask about what might be considered the typical baseline architecture for a general-purpose IoT system. </p>

I'm also not particularly interested in the detail of the local network between nodes, except where the details directly influence the overall network topology.</p>

<p>I'm not looking for an exhaustive description, just capturing of the current norm. What <em>general</em> network topology is in typical use today, and provides a good scalable model covering at least these features:</p>

<ul>
<li>local, networked control</li>
<li>remote access</li>
<li>sensor nodes in multiple locations</li>
<li>data aggregation (for machine learning, etc.)</li>
<li>sharing of data (trusted neighbours, etc)</li>

1054,1054,,,"<p>For simplicity, I'll describe this using a typical smart-home setup as a reference, but nothing here is really fixed by the application. The high level topology is equally suitable for a farm monitoring application covering several kilometres with thousands or sensors, tracking parking spaces in a city, or lighting management in an office building.</p>

<p>I'll treat the problem approximately in layers of device hierarchy, which might correspond to increasing complexity of an installation, or pulling in specific use case scenarios. Here is my generalised diagram covering the whole network.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YMRCQ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YMRCQ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><strong>Node level</strong>
The individual node in my diagram is a WiFi connected lamp with a local physical override switch. The node often has both sensor and control functions, and a small amount of local compute/storage. Ideally, the node can act autonomously. The node can take control from local switches, directly over the LAN (if it has WiFi/Bluetooth), or from either the local hub or the cloud. A node will frequently maintain a persistent TCP connection with the hub or cloud.</p>

<p>One location typically contains several nodes, with different functions, using various connectivity options. A smart-home might collect indoor/outdoor temperature, activity and video data. Remote sensors may use disparate connections to the internet.</p>

<p><strong>Hub Level</strong> In a smart home, there might be several hubs (one for each device vendor), aggregation or hierarchy. The hub can be combined in the router, or stand-alone. The hub doesn't even need to be active in the network (other than to forward packets). However, the hub might be responsible for relaying commands to a node - commands originating from either other locally connected nodes or from a remote server. The hub might implement store-forward of data, compression or filtering of data. Really, the hub is just a facilitator. Today, the hub is the first part of the network that has the ability to provide public DNS, which makes it able to publish network structure information to the full system. As described in <a href=""http://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/958/why-do-i-need-hubs-for-some-devices-when-automating-my-home"">this question</a> a hub is often necessary to bridge between Wired/WiFi TCP-IP to a low-power radio protocol, such as ZigBee or BT-LE.</p>

<p><strong>Roaming Terminals</strong> Otherwise known as your smartphone. These are often the primary point of user interaction. A simple node can present it's entire user-interface through a smartphone, once the node can establish either a direct or a mediated link with a specific device. Achieving this fundamentally requires a mechanism for establishing trust/ownership/pairing. A terminal can establish if it's own hub is on the local network, if it needs to perform <em>all</em> communication via an external server, or if it is able to lookup the IP address which allows direct routing to it's 'home' hub. The latter scenario usually requires that the router is configured for port forwarding.</p>

<p><strong>Cloud service</strong> It is common for the cloud service to perform the majority of the work in the stack, although this is not always necessary (and not all implementations will require any cloud function). The most useful feature that an external (publicly addressed) server can provide is orchestration. Every node and intermediate element of the network is usually able to communicate over a direct channel to this server, and the server can easily pass messages from one device to the others. The server can aggregate data and present visualisations to the user. Based on the user's configuration, it can also forward information to other users (access and heating control can be granted to guests for example, flood/fire/intrusion warnings could use other network options to generate alerts). The cloud is also well placed to take in other data sources, so modifying heating profiles based on forecast and calendar information, or feeding local sensor information into local forecasting models, generating alerts for utility providers and so on.</p>

1063,1063,,,"<p>There are many factors in choosing whether to process data on-device or in the cloud.</p>

<h1>Benefits of processing in the cloud</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>If the algorithm uses floating-point or runs on a GPU, it might not be possible to run on the embedded processor in the sensor.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if it doesn't, if the algorithm was developed in a high-level language, it might be too expensive (in developer time) to port it to run on the sensor.</p></li>
<li><p>Offloading computation from the sensor may increase its battery life (depending on how this affects network/radio use).</p></li>
<li><p>Running the algorithm in the cloud allows it to combine the data from many sensors and make a system-level decision. In this example, that might mean filtering across different cars' sensors, so that washing one car doesn't cause a rain warning in every car.</p></li>
<li><p>Processing in the cloud allows to distribute the information to many places without having to have a mesh network, which is a complicated architecture.</p></li>
<li><p>You can log more data, which enables better analytics, audit, and development of better algorithms.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>Benefits of processing on-board</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>If the raw sensor data is high-bandwidth, it might use less battery to summarise the data and send the summary (depending on what processing is needed to <em>summarise</em> it). This might mean that instead of sending an 8-bit moisture reading 100 times a second, you filter it and send a 1-bit wet/dry flag every 10 seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>You might go further, and only wake up the network at all when the sensor has something interesting-looking to report (e.g. the wet/dry state changes)</p></li>
<li><p>Reducing the network bandwidth at the sensor end also reduces it at the server end, so you can scale the service to more users (more sensors) very cheaply.</p></li>
<li><p>It might be possible to run the service with the same or reduced functionality even when the network is unavailable. In this example, your car might be able to warn you about slippery roads it sees itself, but not give you advance warning from other cars.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>Overall</h1>

<p>Usually, some combination of the two is optimal. You might do as much processing as you can afford to do on the device, to reduce the need for the network as much as you can, and then run more sophisticated algorithms in the cloud that can combine more inputs or use more compute power.</p>

<p>You might start out running all of your processing in the cloud (because it was prototyped in Matlab or Python) and port parts gradually to Rust to enable offline functionality, when you have developer time to spend on it.</p>

<p>You might process the data heavily on the device in normal use but also sample and log the raw data sometimes, so that you can upload it to the cloud later (when network is more available) for your analytics.</p>

1068,1068,,,"<h2>Push vs Poll</h2>

<p>Your proposed solution of sending frequent AJAX requests sounds a lot like <em>polling</em> - you're sending a request every so often to check if the state has changed. It would make far more sense to <em>push</em> changes to the server when the piezo sensor detects a change.</p>

<p>It's the difference between this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Server: <em>Is there someone at the door?</em>
  Sensor: <strong><em>No</em></strong>.<br>
  Server: <em>Is there someone at the door?</em>
  Sensor: <strong><em>No</em></strong>.<br>
  Server: <em>Is there someone at the door?</em>
  Sensor: <strong><em>No</em></strong>.<br>
  <em>... repeat ad infinitum ...</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sensor: <em>There's someone at the door!</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first example is polling, and the second is pushing. You can tell which one will have lower power usage, less complex code and reduced network usage.</p>

<h2>HTTP or Something Else?</h2>

<p>An AJAX request is sent over HTTP, so it's quite heavyweight and requires several <a href=""http://www.inetdaemon.com/tutorials/internet/tcp/3-way_handshake.shtml"" rel=""noreferrer"">TCP handshakes</a> <em>per connection</em> (unless you use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_persistent_connection"" rel=""noreferrer"">Keep-Alive</a>). </p>

<p>It may be worth considering alternative protocols such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT"" rel=""noreferrer"">MQTT</a> (there's some good explanation in the question '<a href=""http://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/44/when-and-why-to-use-mqtt-protocol"">When and why to use MQTT protocol?</a>', which has a very similar problem to yours).</p>

<p>A message broker like MQTT might be a little bit more powerful than you really need in your current situation, but one MQTT broker could easily be expanded if you chose to add more devices to your smart home network, whereas your current system of AJAX requests would quickly fall apart. Imagine four or five different devices polling each other; it'd quickly lead to your network becoming overloaded and it would be a massive drain on power usage.</p>

<h2>Node and Web Sockets</h2>

<p>Using web sockets and Node would solve the issue of using <em>push</em> instead of <em>poll</em>, so it would be a good idea in my opinion. <strong>However</strong>, I suspect polling would work if you really didn't want to learn Node.</p>

<p>If you want an <strong>extensible solution</strong> that will work when you expand your smart home, definitely go with pushing - it'll save a lot of trouble and tears. If you just want a quick proof of concept, polling will probably work.</p>

<p>My personal advice is that you <strong>should</strong> either learn web sockets or investigate using a message broker like MQTT. You could use a client library like <a href=""https://github.com/mgdm/Mosquitto-PHP"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mosquitto-PHP</a> (with a <a href=""http://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-client-library-encyclopedia-mosquitto-php"" rel=""noreferrer"">guide by HiveMQ</a>) to simplify using MQTT in PHP, or just go with Node and web sockets.

<li>receive</li>

These functions would be different for Wi-Fi and Cellular under the hood but the interface will be the same, and the result would be the same: <strong>Internet connection</strong>. The caller class/code would not know if it is a Cellular or Wi-Fi connection, it would only know that there are <code>connect/disconnect/send/receive</code> functions to use and there are <strong>Internet</strong>.</p>

<p>So when you do the testing you will have a Wi-Fi class instance and when you have finished debugging you could simply change it to a Cellular class instance.</p>

1073,1073,,,"<p>This is a question on basic physics. Provided all parts of your network are moving at the same speed (give or take) then there is no impact of being in a moving reference frame (as we all are on Earth).</p>

<p>For long-range radio protocols, there is a need to account for the round trip delay (transmit/receive/transmit synchronisation), and having one end of the link in motion will have the effect of making the two parts of the delay asymmetric. This means that mobile terminal protocols <em>do</em> need some design consideration to allow for the right sort of guard band treatment.</p>

<p>For the specific case of Bluetooth LE, the range is probably too small for transmission to take place in the presence of a significant velocity offset. Even on a rotating object, the velocity will probably be reasonably constrained compared to the bit timing/propagation delay.</p>

1074,1074,,,"<p>Reliable communications between digital devices requires some degree of signal processing to synchronize the data and the timing (clock). Adding relative motion between the transmitter and receiver can complicate the problem. You are probably aware that relative motion can impart Doppler frequency shifts. This also affects the timing of the bit stream.</p>

1097,1097,,,"<h2>As a consumer</h2>

<p>Your options are often quite limited as a consumer, but you can minimise your risks in a few ways through carefully selecting the products you use and how you connect them.</p>

<h3>Check what happens when your device loses Internet connectivity</h3>

<p>Usually, you can just do a quick Google search to see what happens when a certain device disconnects from the Internet. Some devices will simply fail completely if their connection to a remote cloud server is lost, like the <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201549640"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Amazon Echo</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your Echo requires an active Wi-Fi connection to speak, process your commands, and stream media.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes, there's a good reason (for example, the Echo has to stream commands to the cloud to process your instructions, as stated in '<a href=""http://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/357/is-the-amazon-echo-always-listening-and-sending-data-to-the-cloud"">Is the Amazon Echo &#39;always listening&#39; and sending data to the cloud?</a>'), but for others, it may just be an oversight or design flaw in your product.</p>

<p>If you physically have the device, you could try unplugging your router to see what happens—this might not be a great test, because it's more likely a remote server will break but local connections will still work, but it's something to try.</p>

<p>With enough time to <s>waste</s> <em>use productively to improve your setup</em>, you could potentially sniff packets from your devices, then apply a router-level block to certain domains—this way, you'd know what happened if <code>mydeviceserver.com</code> went down completely. Of course, this would take <strong>a long time</strong> so it might not be practical to test all of your devices in a large home with lots of 'smart' devices.</p>

<h3>Use local connectivity</h3>

<p>If you're just turning your lights on from your smart switch, you might not need to route all the traffic through the Internet, into a cloud server thousands of miles away, and back to your lightbulb—you might just be able to route the command through local devices instead. A lot of the time, these devices will use a protocol like ZigBee or Z-Wave, so you might need a hub to co-ordinate the traffic (see '<a href=""http://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/958/why-do-i-need-hubs-for-some-devices-when-automating-my-home"">Why do I need hubs for some devices when automating my home?</a>').</p>

<h2>As a developer</h2>

<p>For developers of IoT devices, careful design of a device can avoid problems like the recent S3 outage from affecting consumers. Of course, IoT designers <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/03/02/chinese_iot_kit_backdoor_claims/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">aren't always known</a> for <em>careful</em> design, but if you're reading this, you're probably not in that group.</p>

<h3>Design services to be redundant</h3>

<p>For Amazon S3's recent outage in particular, there may not have been much you could do. There are some reports that <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-cross-region-replication-for-amazon-s3/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cross-region replication</a> could have potentially prevented services from going down, as explained in <a href=""http://devops.stackexchange.com/questions/83/what-is-a-good-strategy-to-keep-my-site-online-when-s3-goes-offline"">this question on DevOps Stack Exchange</a>, but it's <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/5xat9a/s3_crossregion_replication_would_it_have_really/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">debated whether that's really true or just poor advice</a>. </p>

<p>If feasible, having some sort of redundancy or backup would be ideal—although the costs are greater, the additional reliability is greatly needed—otherwise, people's lights stop responding, power switches refuse to work, etc.</p>

<h3>Add better support for scenarios without Internet connections</h3>

<p>I listed 'Use local connectivity' under the ways that a consumer could avoid this issue, <strong>but it's a losing battle</strong>. The devices often don't support connecting in any other way than through their approved web service, and manufacturers are reluctant to spend developer time on this. If the support was greater, there would be less reliance on cloud services, which benefits the manufacturer too, because they don't need to pay for so much server capacity.</p>

<h2>With all these options, why were so many devices affected?</h2>

<p><em>Because no-one wants to spend the time</em>—designing any sort of reliable system takes a lot of time and effort, and it's often far more complex than the comparable 'dumb' solution (e.g. simple electrical switches). </p>

<p><a href=""http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/41050/why-isnt-software-as-reliable-as-a-car"">Why isn't software as reliable as a car?</a> Because the software has so much more complexity, yet isn't tested nearly as rigorously as a car would be.

1101,1101,,,"<p>One idea might be to use multiple <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Function as a Service</a> providers (e.g. <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AWS Lambda</a>, <a href=""https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/functions/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Azure Functions</a> or <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Google Cloud Functions</a>) so that if one fails, the other services can be used instead.</p>

<p>As serverless (Function as a Service) providers typically charge by the number of invocations instead of by the time used, the cost implication is probably not so concerning—if you used AWS Lambda 99% of the time and only used Azure when AWS was down, you'd still only be paying once for each function invocation rather than paying for the use of multiple physical services.</p>

<p>Of course, most cloud services will rely on more than just computation—the storage aspect is still important, and would likely be a different single point of failure. You could potentially replicate that too across different providers, but at this point it starts to get expensive, because you <em>are</em> paying multiple times for the storage of your data, and it could easily get out of sync, adding complexity to the service.</p>

<p>Imagine setting your smart thermostat to 20°C on your phone—it might synchronise that data with cloud server #1, which then crashes before the data is pushed to the other storage, so cloud server #2 thinks that you still want your thermostat at 10°C, and you get home to a freezing house.</p>

Even though that's a vast simplification there is very little cross-provider load-balancing. Thus, if your AWS load balancer shuts down there is no use in having tons of Google Cloud Functions and OneDrive storage available. Your IoT devices won't find their way towards those services. They will be looking at the false domains/IPs for your cloud service.</p>

<p>The rest is set up redundantly anyways. What happened to Amazon is that they inadvertently shut down their single point of failure. That one server with the big red <strong><em>never shut it down</em></strong> sign. By mistake they took down the <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/de/message/41926/"" rel=""noreferrer"">indexing server for the S3 on the east coast</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of these subsystems, the index subsystem, manages the metadata and location information of all S3 objects in the region. This subsystem is necessary to serve all GET, LIST, PUT, and DELETE requests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Essentially the service that knows what's where. However you design your infrastructure there will always be similar points. Just take it from Amazon, even the number #1 cloud provider didn't dare to touch that system.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While this is an operation that we have relied on to maintain our systems since the launch of S3, we have not completely restarted the index subsystem or the placement subsystem in our larger regions for many years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you read their blog to the end, they have no actual solution to that. They are just trying to reduce the chance it happens again. There will always be critical points where you can't have redundancies—or redundancies that area extremely costly.</p>

<p>At the end it likely is cheaper to have the service go down and wait for the big three cloud providers to get it back up.</p>

<p>Doubling costs isn't really ""technically infeasible"", it justs make the situation more expensive.  However, it's not really that bad.</p>

<p>I work for a service that rents dedicated hardware at three different data centers from three different vendors, one in the west, one in the east, and one in the midwest.  Our client application automatically, constantly, and seamlessly switches to whatever center responds quickest.  (The server side doesn't even have to do ""load balancing""; the client side does ""load distribution"" instead.)  Since starting up years ago, there has never been a moment when at least 2 of the 3 centers wasn't responding.</p>

<p>The costs to rent and operate those servers is minuscule.  We could easily expand to more data centers using petty cash, but it's not necessary, because the three existing systems provide plenty of redundancy and plenty of throughput.</p>

</ul>

<hr>

<p>In theory, if your router prevents all incoming connections, it makes it significantly harder for Mirai to get in and infect your devices. The publicly-available <a href=""https://github.com/jgamblin/Mirai-Source-Code"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source code of Mirai</a> seems to suggest that it just sends packets to as many IPs as it can, and if there's a reply, it then randomly tries the default passwords that it knows. <a href=""http://iot.stackexchange.com/a/913/12"">I wrote an answer previously about that</a>, if you're interested.</p>

<p>My concern would be that if Mirai did manage to enter your home network—through just <em>one</em> misconfigured or insecure device—it would render all of your firewalls and security useless. One of Mirai's IP ranges to check is <code>192.168.0.0/16</code> (your router's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">private network</a>), so Mirai would almost certainly spread through all your vulnerable devices.</p>

<p>The solution to stop Mirai from being able to attack your network is simple—<strong>change every device's password from its default, and restart the device</strong>. If you do that, Mirai can't attack <em>even if your device is accessible through the Internet</em> (not to say it's a good idea to <em>make</em> things accessible if not necessary, though!).</p>

1118,1118,,,"<p>The model that IoT Hub connected devices use is that they will never accept incoming connections. IoT Hub devices never act as a 'server', and this is a crucial part of the security model in Azure IoT. The definitive model on this is encapsulated in Clemens Vasters' <a href=""https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/clemensv/2014/02/09/service-assisted-communication-for-connected-devices/"" rel=""noreferrer"">'Service Assisted Communication'</a>.</p>

<p>Therefore devices are always 'polling' an external service in order to send data or receive commands. The APIs make it look like data is being sent to a device, but it is always the device making the outgoing connection.</p>

<p>IoT hub does this in two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>By sending data to the device endpoint <code>/devices/{deviceId}/messages/devicebound</code>. This is an AMQP messaging endpoint, similar to a queue or topic subscription. The device, when reading commands, needs to acknowledged receipt if needed, which is part of the underlying AMQP protocol. This works the same with MQTT, and https is a valid fallback.
The API wraps all of this up for you. There are additional concepts, such as 'direct methods' which are an API wrapper around essentially the same underlying message protocol</li>
<li>By using the server-side device twin, which is a way to logically keep properties in sync between device and server. You set a property on the device twin, and when the device syncs up that property will be synced to the device. This is less message-based and built on top of the LWM2M device management protocol.</li>
</ol>

<p>A lot of the 'polling', connecting, sharing connections, receipts, etc should be taken care of as part of the AMQP (or MQTT) protocol, which in turn is wrapped up in the IoT Hub SDK. So the above is highly simplified, but to reiterate, IoT Hub cannot, and will not (ever) try and send data to a ip address/port on your device.</p>

<h2>Yes, it's actually quite simple.</h2>

<p>The issue is not so much with the operating system as it is that mydlink.com has not officially supported the Ubuntu operating system.  Therefore, all that is necessary is to fake your user agent.  There are several options on how to do this:</p>

<h3>1. Directly from the Chrome console</h3>

<p>Simply follow these steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Press F12.</li>
<li>Click on the Console Tab</li>
<li>Click on the Hamburger Menu > <code>More Tools</code> > <code>Network Conditions</code></li>

<p>If you're not completely familiar with how Alexa Skills work, here's a brief summary:</p>

<li><p>First, you <a href=""https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/registering-and-managing-alexa-skills-in-the-developer-portal"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">register your Skill with Amazon</a>, providing an <a href=""https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/defining-the-voice-interface#introduction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>intent schema</em> and <em>sample utterances</em></a>. The intent schema defines which actions can be performed, and the <a href=""https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/built-in-intent-ref/slot-type-reference"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>slots</em></a> for custom data to be sent to your API. The sample utterances provide examples of how a user can trigger each intent.</p></li>
<li><p>When the user activates your Skill, Alexa will try to match what they said to one of your skill's sample utterances. If it <strong>does</strong> match, it will send an HTTPS request to your server to ask for a response.</p></li>
<li><p>Your server provides a response (if all goes well) and then Alexa will give feedback to the user who triggered your skill.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href=""https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/alexa-skills-kit-interaction-model-reference#literal-slot-type-reference"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>AMAZON.LITERAL</code> slot</a> allows you to accept virtually any input. Note that currently it is only supported in the English (US) region—English (UK) and German skills cannot use <code>AMAZON.LITERAL</code>.</p>

<p>Your intent schema might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
  ""intents"": [
    {
      ""intent"": ""SaveTodo"",
      ""slots"": [
        {
          ""name"": ""Todo"",
          ""type"": ""AMAZON.LITERAL""
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>And your sample utterances might be like this:</p>

<pre><code>SaveTodo remind me to {fetch the shopping|Todo}
SaveTodo remind me to {write my English essay|Todo}
SaveTodo remind me to {buy some dog food tomorrow|Todo}
</code></pre>

<p>When using <code>AMAZON.LITERAL</code>, you need to provide <em>lots</em> of sample utterances—at least one sample for each possible length of input, but ideally more. The Amazon documentation suggests that you should be aiming for hundreds of samples for slots where you could accept various types of inputs.</p>

<p>It does seem a little tedious, but if you don't do this, it's unlikely that your skill will recognise text well. You could perhaps generate sample utterances from customer data (so long as personal information is removed beforehand!) so that the most common utterances are in your samples—I suspect Alexa will be slightly biased towards recognising utterances similar to the samples.</p>

<p>Amazon <a href=""https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/migrating-to-the-improved-built-in-and-custom-slot-types#literal"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">discourage <code>AMAZON.LITERAL</code> slots though, and would prefer you to use custom slot types</a>, which require you to list the possible inputs. It's important to remember that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A custom slot type is not the equivalent of an enumeration. Values outside the list may still be returned if recognized by the spoken language understanding system. Although input to a custom slot type is weighted towards the values in the list, it is not constrained to just the items on the list. Your code still needs to include validation and error checking when using slot values.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Currently, I am using my phone.</p>

<p>So either I set a timer for 5 minutes when it's 12pm or I set an alarm to ring at 12:05pm. If timer: I want an option to autorestart after dismiss (so far I haven't found any). If alarm: I want an option to snooze not so easily (with I Can't Wake Up, I can make it so that I have to slide up to snooze or slide down to dismiss).</p>

<p>But it's a hassle to get my phone out every time wherein sometimes I have to first unlock the phone first snoozing the alarm (I Can't Wake Up has 'Quit Block', but I have yet to try this).</p>

<p>I'm hoping some smartwatch has the ability to go off at 12:05pm or 5 minutes after I set the timer (which would be around 12pm) so that I just have to swipe my watch instead of taking out my phone.</p>

If you don't actually need to do that, you might not need a hub at all.</p>

<p>A ZigBee network (whether it's a mesh, star or tree) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZigBee#Overview"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">requires a coordinator</a> device.

<p>If you were just connecting a switch to a lightbulb, you could do it without a hub. However, at that point, ask yourself: <em>is this really better than just connecting the bulb to a switch with a wire?</em> The whole point of automating your home is so that you can control things remotely from other devices (or a hub to schedule things automatically). </p>

1136,1136,,,"<p>Are you asking about the <em>protocol</em> or the <em>message format</em>? We often incorrectly use the term protocol when we mean the format of the data. I do this myself, often because the distinction isn't clear to everyone.</p>

<p>Messaging protocols used in IoT tend to be fairly compact, at least more so than http and offer significant features that are important in messaging (sessions, flow control, reliability, etc). The message format is the  of data in the message that get sent. I assume that this is what you are asking about.</p>

<p>The most compact message format is a carefully considered hand-rolled binary format. It is frequently used when in low-bandwidth scenarios when you want to send a few bytes, and know exactly what those bytes look like. For larger messages the disadvantages are significant and, in general, should be avoided at all costs.</p>

<p>I went through a detailed assessment on many different data serialisation options. I expected protobuf, messagepack to be fairly compact, which they were. However, my second problem was finding libraries that were maintained and available on a number of different platforms, including C on the device.</p>

<p>The format that I settled on, surprisingly, was gzip compressed JSON. It is easy to implement and understand, runs everywhere, and, with the data that I was using, was about the same, or smaller, than other methods.</p>

<p>Also beware that if you have a secure channel such as TLS, you're going to consume a chunk of data (>6KB) in TLS handshakes anyway.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I expected a format like protocol buffers to dominate, but not much really happened. Probably because of the ease at which json can be written out and parsed (and compressed). I like the look of <a href=""https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Flatbuffers</a>, but the advantage is more on parsing speed than being compact.</p>
