<p>Currently, there are no threat. </p>

<p>The threat comes if humans create a so-called ultraintelligent machine, a machine that can surpass all intellectual activities by any human. This would be the last invention man would need to do, since this machine is better in inventing machines than humans are (since that is an intellectual activity).  However, this could cause the machine to invent machines that can destruct humans, and we can't stop them because they are so much smarter than we are.</p>

That is to say, leading to something that more intelligent than we area.</p>

<p>But here's my (somewhat shorter) answer: intelligence is all about decision-making, and we don't have any reason to believe that humans are anywhere near close to being the best possible at decision-making. Once we are able to build an AI AI researcher (that is, a computer that knows how to make computers better at thinking), the economic and military relevance of humans will rapidly disappear as any decision that could be made by a human could be made better by a computer. (Why have human generals instead of robot generals, human engineers instead of robot engineers, and so on.)</p>

<p>This isn't necessarily a catastrophe. If the Vulcans showed up tomorrow and brought better decision-making to Earth, we could avoid a lot of misery. The hard part is making sure that what we get are Vulcans who want us around and happy, instead of something that doesn't share our values.</p>

<p>Fuzzy logic is an extension of Boolean logic by Lotfi Zadeh in 1965 based on the
mathematical theory of fuzzy sets, which is a generalization of the classical set theory.
By introducing the notion of <em>degree in the verification</em> of a condition, thus enabling a
condition to be in a state other than true or false, fuzzy logic provides a very valuable
flexibility for reasoning, which makes it possible to take into account inaccuracies and
uncertainties.</p>

<p>One advantage of fuzzy logic in order to formalize human reasoning is that the rules
are set in natural language. For example, here are some rules of conduct that a driver
follows, assuming that he does not want to lose his driver’s licence:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TM2UE.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TM2UE.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Intuitively, it thus seems that the input variables like in this example are approximately
appreciated by the brain, such as the degree of verification of a condition in fuzzy
logic.</p>

Fuzzy logic is the same apart from you can have truth values which are in-between true and false, that is to say you are working with any number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (inclusive). The fact that you can have a 'partially true and partially false' truth value is where the word ""fuzzy"" comes from. Natural languages often use fuzzy logic like ""that balloon is red"" meaning that balloon could be any colour which is similar enough to red, or ""the shower is warm"". Here is a rough diagram for how ""the temperature of the shower is warm"" could be represented in terms of fuzzy logic (the y axis being the truth value and the x axis being the temperature):</p>

<p>Fuzzy logic can be applied to boolean operations such as <strong>and</strong>, <strong>or</strong>, and <strong>not</strong>. These would work like:</p>

<pre><code>A and B = A x B = min(A,B)
A or B  = 1-(1-A)x(1-B) = max(A,B)
not A   = 1-A
(where A and B are real values from 0 (inclusive) to 1 (inclusive) and
min and max return the smallest and the largest value of the two arguments given)

<p>The fuzziness about the singularity comes from the fact that, from the singularity onwards, history is effectively unpredictable. Humankind would be unable to predict any future events, or explain any present events, as science itself becomes incapable of describing machine-triggered events. Essentially, machines would think of us the same way we think of ants. Thus, we can make no predictions past the singularity. Furthermore, as a logical consequence, we'd be unable to define the point at which the singularity may occur at all, or even recognize it when it happens.</p>

Moreover, an algorithm that creates superhuman intelligence out of bits and bytes would have to be designed. By definition, a human programmer wouldn't be able to do such a thing, as his/her brain would need to be able to comprehend concepts beyond its range. There is also the argument that an intelligence explosion (the mechanism by which a technological singularity would theoretically be formed) would be impossible due to the difficulty of the design challenge of making itself more intelligent, getting larger proportionally to its intelligence, and that the difficulty of the design itself may overtake the intelligence required to solve said challenge (last point credit to <a href=""http://ai.stackexchange.com/users/47/god-of-llamas"">god of llamas</a> in the comments).</p>

Even if Asimov's laws were not enough, a series of constraints would still be necessary in order to avoid the misuse of AGI by misintentioned individuals, and Asimov's laws are the nearest we have to that.</p>

Many economic problems can be cast as optimization problems: for example, FedEx may have a list of packages and the destinations for those packages, and must decide which packages to put on which trucks, and what order to deliver those packages in.</p>

<p>If you write out a mathematical description of this problem, there are a truly stunning number of possible solutions, and a well-defined way to evaluate which of two solutions is better. A solver is an algorithm that will evaluate a solution, come up with another solution, and then evaluate that one, and so on.</p>

<p>In small cases and simple problems, the solver can also terminate with a proof that it is actually the best solution possible. But typically instead the solver just reports ""this is the best solution that I've seen,"" and that's used. An improvement in the solver means you can reliably get lower-cost solutions than you were seeing before.</p>

<p>For the SAT problem specifically, the Wikipedia page on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">SAT</a> gives some examples:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since the SAT problem is NP-complete, only algorithms with exponential worst-case complexity are known for it. In spite of this, efficient and scalable algorithms for SAT were developed over the last decade[when?] and have contributed to dramatic advances in our ability to automatically solve problem instances involving tens of thousands of variables and millions of constraints (i.e. clauses).[1] Examples of such problems in electronic design automation (EDA) include formal equivalence checking, model checking, formal verification of pipelined microprocessors,[12] automatic test pattern generation, routing of FPGAs,[14] planning, and scheduling problems, and so on. A SAT-solving engine is now considered to be an essential component in the EDA toolbox.</p>

71,71,,,"<p>A Markov model includes the probability of transitioning to each state considering the current state. ""Each state"" may be just one point - whether it rained on specific day, for instance - or it might look like multiple things - like a pair of words. You've probably seen automatically generated weird text that <em>almost</em> makes sense, like <a href=""https://blog.codinghorror.com/markov-and-you/"">Garkov</a> (the output of a Markov model based on the Garfield comic strips). That Coding Horror article also mentions the applications of Markov techniques to Google's PageRank.</p>

<p>Markov models are really only powerful when they have a lot of input to work with. If a machine looked through a lot of English text, it would get a pretty good idea of what words generally come after other words. Or after looking through someone's location history, it could figure out where that person is likely to go next from a certain place. Constantly updating the ""input corpus"" as more data is received would let the machine tune the probabilities of all the state transitions.</p>

<p>Genetic algorithms are fairly different things. They create functions by shuffling around parts of functions and seeing how good each function is at a certain task. A child algorithm will depend on its parents, but Markov models are interested mostly in predicting what thing will come next in a sequence, not creating a new chunk of code. You might be able to use a Markov model to spit out a candidate function, though, depending on how simple the ""alphabet"" is. You could even then give more weight to the transitions in successful algorithms.</p>

<p>Neither, really. It is a milestone and a significant advance in computers beating humans in games, but the techniques used are only relevant to that game, not for other purposes in AI. </p>

<p>The solution lies in humans analysing the game and implementing algorithms for finding a good move. This is the main reason that a computer can beat the humans, together with the fact that it can calculate much faster and that it doesn't make really bad moves by not seeing something.</p>

<p>Processing power helps, but the game-tree complexity for go is very large, estimated to be larger than 10<sup>200</sup>, whereas the game-tree complexity for chess is only 10<sup>120</sup> (known as the Shannon number), so chess is less hard. This means that for neither chess nor go a database can be created with all possible positions. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We can use the same analogy also against those who, finding a formula their first machine cannot produce as being true, concede that that machine is indeed inadequate, but thereupon seek to construct a second, more adequate, machine, in which the formula can be produced as being true. This they can indeed do: but then the second machine will have a Gödelian formula all of its own, constructed by applying Gödel's procedure to the formal system which represents its (the second machine's) own, enlarged, scheme of operations. And this formula the second machine will not be able to produce as being true, while a mind will be able to see that it is true. And if now a third machine is constructed, able to do what the second machine was unable to do, exactly the same will happen: there will be yet a third formula, the Gödelian formula for the formal system corresponding to the third machine's scheme of operations, which the third machine is unable to produce as being true, while a mind will still be able to see that it is true. And so it will go on.</p>

<p>In short, by making the system more complex, it can see the inadequacy of a less complex system, but a yet more complex system can see its inadequacy. But from whence comes the claim that a mind <em>could</em> see the inadequacy in the <em>n</em>th machine? If, say, the Gödelian formula had as many components to it as a human brain had neurons, it seems suspect to claim that the human <em>could</em> evaluate that formula and identify that it is in fact a Gödelian formula, rather than a similar but not quite identical sentence.  </p>

<p>I am not overly familiar with the history, but I think LISP was oversold to industry as ""the AI language"". It is a good language for humans to think in and pioneered many important ideas which have since been incorporated into many modern languages (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)"" rel=""nofollow"">the Wikipedia page</a>), but it is no way the ""best"". It was likely also popular because it is very expressive: you can write short programs to represent complex ideas, a property it shares with other functional languages in use such as Scala. This also means that it is easy to write a program that is very hard to debug in LISP. Modern functional languages have been trying to do better in this regard through typing etc.</p>

<p>The paradigm for AI that currently receives most attention is Machine Learning, i.e. learning hypothesis from data, as opposed to previous approaches like Expert Systems where experts wrote rules for the AI to follow. Python is currently the most widely used language for prototyping machine learning algorithms and has many libraries and an active community. Another important detail about modern AI is the volume of data it uses. Big Data analysis is done using cluster computing systems like Hadoop (with code written in Java) and Spark (with code written in Python or Scala). Often, the core time-intensive subroutines are written in C, but this is often done in the form of third-party libraries.</p>

<p>Finally it must be said that the AI Winter of the 80s was not because we did not have the right language, but because we did not have the right algorithms and did not have enough computational power. This has changed as GPUs have gotten better. If you're trying to learn AI, spend your time studying algorithms and not languages.</p>

<p>In your example, since there is only one layer (a row of input nodes and a row of output nodes) it is easy to explain what each node represents.

<p>Another way of thinking about it is that they describe hyperplanes in the space of the output of the previous node layer. If each output from the previous layer represents a point in space, a hyperplane decides which part of the space should give a positive value to the plane's corresponding node in the next layer and which part should give a negative input to it.

130,130,,,"<p>First of all, for a detailed view of the argument, check out the <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/"" rel=""nofollow"">SEP entry on the Chinese Room</a>.</p>

<p>I consider the CRA as an indicator of you definition of intelligence. If the argument holds, yes, the person in the room understands Chinese. However, let's sum up the three replies discussed in the SEP entry:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The <em>man</em> himself doesn't understand Chinese (he wouldn't be able to understand it when outside the room), but the <em>system</em> man+room understands it. Accepting that reply suggests that there can exist an intelligent system which parts aren't themselves intelligent (which can be argued of the human body itself).</p></li>
<li><p>The system doesn't understand Chinese, as it cannot interact with the world in the same way a robot or a human could (i.e. it cannot learn, is limited in the set of questions it can answer)</p></li>
<li><p>The system doesn't understand Chinese (depending on your definition of <em>understanding</em>), and you couldn't say a human performing the same feats as the Chinese room understands Chinese either.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So whether the argument, or a variant of it holds, depends on your definitions of <em>intelligent</em>, <em>understanding</em>, on how you define the system, etc. The point being that the thought experiment is a nice way to differentiate between the definitions (and many, many debates have been held about them), in order to avoid talking past each other endlessly.</p>

132,132,,,"<p>There's no objective reason to state that declarative languages are better suited for AI development. However, there's indeed a bias towards them in practice. Although most functional languages are impure (that is, they allow side effects), and such can't count as ""declarative"", a few languages are purely functional (that is, they don't allow side effects), most prominently <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming#Functional_programming"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Haskell</a>. Purity is key here. In Haskell, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/4066401/5249858"">even I/O is pure</a>.</p>

<p>The key difference between imperative languages and (purely) functional languages is in the way they describe the program. An imperative program describes <em>how</em> to do stuff, that is, algorithms. It specifies the specific instructions that the machine must carry on in order to perform the computation. OTOH, purely functional languages describe <em>what</em> is to be computed, that is, the relationship between the input and the output. In mathematics, ""function"" is just a fancy name for a relationship between an input and an output.</p>

<p>Again, in the mathematical sense, the only variability is that of the function's arguments. That is, the function's output depends solely on its input (arguments). This is known as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">referential transparency</a>. Referential transparency states that:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ssAGM.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ssAGM.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Where <code>ϕ</code> is the set of all functions, and <code>δ(f)</code> is <code>f</code>'s domain. For the typical imperative language's definition of ""function"", the above doesn't hold. For instance, C's <code>getchar()</code> does not always return the same value.</p>

<p>Let's say we want to calculate the set of the ten least prime numbers whose least significant digit is 3. First, in mathematical notation:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/F94i9.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/F94i9.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Where <code>G(n, s)</code> is the set of the lesser <code>n</code>th elements from <code>s</code>. In mathematics, you don't worry about how is the set <code>S</code> supposed to be computed, but rather about <code>S</code>'s definition itself.</p>

<p>Now, in Python (in imperative style):</p>

<pre><code>def is_prime(n):
  for x in range(2, n):
    if n % x == 0:
      return False

  return True

def foo():
  s = set()
  n = 2
  while len(s) &lt; 10:
    if is_prime(n) and n % 10 == 3:
       s.append(n)

  return set(s)
</code></pre>

<p>In Python, we care about (and are responsible for) the algorithm being used to compute the set. We specify, pretty much in recipe-style, how to build the set from scratch. If there's an algorithm that may be better suited for checking whether a number is prime or odd, but we don't use it, it's our fault, not Python's.</p>

<p>Finally, Haskell steps in:</p>

<pre><code>import qualified Data.Set as Set

isPrime :: Integer -&gt; Bool
isPrime n = ( == 1 ) . length . filter ( == 0 ) . map ( n `mod` ) $ [ 2 .. n ]

s = Set.fromList . take 10 . filter ( ( == 3 ) . ( `mod` 10 ) ) . filter isPrime $ [1..]
</code></pre>

<p>Haskell's version is a lot more like the mathematical model than Python is. We define the <code>isPrime</code> function in terms of the constraints that a prime number must obey, not by describing a step-by-step algorithm to do such a check. Moreover, <code>s</code> (the set we have been defining so far) is defined in terms of the constraints its members must obey, rather than in terms of an algorithm to compute <code>s</code> itself. The compiler, more often than not <a href=""https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.8.3/docs/html/users_guide/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System</a> (a.k.a GHC), is the one responsible for generating an algorithm. GHC's optimizer is known to be one of the strongest in the world, not because its the best compiler of 'em all, but because Haskell's nature allows for this.</p>

<p>Haskell (and other functional languages), in summary, have several features that make it look, taste, and behave like pure math:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Referential transparency and purity.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Haskell is lazy</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/279316/what-exactly-makes-the-haskell-type-system-so-revered-vs-say-java"">A <strong>very</strong> strong type system</a>, with such exotic (but very useful!) stuff as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_data_type"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">recursive</a> (and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">algebraic</a>) data types.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, the bottom line is that AI researchers often prefer functional languages over imperative languages (or, more assertively, pure over impure languages), because they are attempting to <em>define</em> artificial intelligence itself, by means of functions (relationship between an input and an output). At the end, we do this because we have no real algorithm for human-level intelligence to raise from a handful of transistors. Also, there's been a historical bias towards these kind of languages, starting with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">John McCarthy</a>, Lisp's creator and a pioneer in early AI research.</p>

It holds conveniently in practice, but the terms come from elsewhere. In 1980, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Searle"">John Searle</a> coined the following statements:</p>

<ul>
<li>AI hypothesis, strong form: an AI system can <em>think</em> and have a <em>mind</em> (in the philosophical definition of the term);</li>
<li>AI hypothesis, weak form: an AI system can only <em>act</em> like it thinks and has a mind.</li>
</ul>

<p>So <em>strong AI</em> is a shortcut for an AI systems that verifies the <em>strong AI hypothesis</em>. Similarly, for the weak form. The terms have then evolved: strong AI refers to AI that performs as well as humans (who have minds), weak AI refers to AI that doesn't.</p>

<p>The problem with these definitions is that they're fuzzy. For example, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo"">AlphaGo</a> is an example of weak AI, but is ""strong"" by Go-playing standards.

135,135,,,"<p>In some iterative learning methods the more iterations you apply the more specific your model becomes about the training set. If there are too much iterations, your model will become too specifically trained for the training samples and will score less on other samples that are not seen during the training phase. This is call over-fitting, though over-fitting is not specific to iterative learning methods.</p>

<p>One solution to prevent over-fitting in these iterative learning algorithms is early stopping. Normally a control group of samples called validation samples (validation set) are used to validate the model and notify when it starts to over-fit. The validation set is not used by the training algorithm however its corresponding outputs are known and after each iteration its samples are employed to measure how good the model currently works. As soon as the performance on the validation set stops to grow and starts to drop we stop iterating the training algorithm. This is called early stopping which can help to maximize the generalization power of our learned model.</p>

<p>Note that if we use the training set itself for validation the performance will always increase because that is what the learning algorithm is designed to do. However the learning algorithm does not know how specifically it should learn the training set and that is why we need methods like early stopping.</p>

Instead of learning from input-output examples (supervised learning) or from rewards (reinforcement learning), an agent with mirror neurons would be able to learn by simply observing other agents, translating their movements to its own coordinate system. What do we have on this subject regarding computational models?</p>

There is still momentum due to so many people using it in the past, who are still active in the industry or research (anecdote: the last VCR was produced by a Japanese maker in July 2016, yes). The language is however used (to my knowledge) for the kind of AI that does not leverage Machine Learning, typically as the reference books from Russell and Norvig. These applications are still very useful, but Machine Learning gets all the steam these days.</p>

<p>Another reason for the decline is that LISP practitioners have partially moved to Clojure and other recent languages.</p>

<p>If you are learning about AI technologies, LISP (or Scheme or Prolog) is good choice to understand what is going on with ""AI"" at large. But if you wish or have to be very pragmatic, Python or R are the community choices</p>

<p>Note: The above lacks concrete example and reference. I am aware of some work in universities, and some companies inspired by or directly using LISP.</p>

<hr>

<p>To add on @Harsh's answer, LISP (and Scheme, and Prolog) has qualities that made it look like it was better suited for creating intelligent mechanisms---making AI as perceived in the 60s.</p>

<p>One of the qualities was that the language design leads the developer to think in a quite elegant way, to decompose a big problem into small problems, etc. Quite ""clever"", or ""intelligent"" if you will. Compared to some other languages, there is almost no choice but to develop that way. LISP is a list processing language, and ""purely functional"".</p>

<p>One problem, though, can be seen in work related to LISP. A notable one in the AI domain is the work on the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_calculus"" rel=""nofollow"">Situation Calculus</a>, where (in short) one describes objects and rules in a ""world"", and can let it evolve to compute <em>situations</em>---states of the world. So it is a model for reasoning on situations. The main problem is called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">frame problem</a>, meaning this calculus cannot tell what does <em>not</em> change---just what changes. Anything that is not defined in the world cannot be processed (note the difference here with ML). First implementations used LISPs, because that was the AI language then. And there were bound by the frame problem. But, as @Harsh mentioned, it is not LISP's fault: Any language would face the same framing issue (a conceptual problem of the Situation Calculus).</p>

<p>So the language really does not matter from the AI / AGI / ASI perspective. The concepts (algorithms, etc.) are really what matters.</p>

<p>Even in Machine Learning, the language is just a practical choice. Python and R are popular today, primarily due to their library ecosystem and the focus of key companies. But try to use Python or R to run a model for a RaspberryPI-based application, and you will face some severe limitations (but still possible, I am doing it :-)). So the language choice burns down to pragmatism.</p>

157,157,,,"<p>The flaw in your argument is that ""surpass"" doesn't just mean that you should be able to run all algorithms, it includes a notion of complexity, i.e. how many time steps you will take to simulate an algorithm. </p>

<p>How do you simulate an algorithm with a Turing machine? A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine"" rel=""nofollow"">Turing machine</a> consists of a finite state machine and an infinite tape. A TM does run an algorithm, determined by its initial state and the state transition matrix, but what I think you are talking about is Universal Turing Machines (UTM)  that can read ""code"" (which is usually a description of another Turing machine) written on a ""code segment"" of the tape and then simulate that machine on input data written on the ""data segment"" of the tape.</p>

<p>Turing machines can differ in the number of states in their finite state machines (and also in the alphabet they write on the tape but any finite alphabet is easily encoded in binary so this should not be the big reason for differences among Turing machines). So, you can have UTMs with bigger state machines and UTMs with smaller state machines. The bigger UTM could possibly surpass the smaller one if they use the same encoding for the ""code"" part of the tape.</p>

<p>You can also play around with the code used to describe the TM being simulated. This code could be C++ for example, or could be a Neural network with the synapse strength written down as a matrix. Which description is better for computation depends on the problem.</p>

<p>An example comparison among UTMs with different state machines: consider different compilers for the same language, say C++. Both of them will first compile C++ to assembly and then run another UTM which reads and executes assembly (your physical CPU). So, a better compiler will run the same code faster.</p>

<p>Back to humans vs computers, humans are neural networks that run algorithms like those you would write in C++. This involves a costly and inefficient conversion of the algorithm into hand movements. A computer uses a compiler to convert C++ to assembly that it can run natively, so its able to do a much more efficient implementation of C++ code. Alternately, humans have a ton of neurons, and the neural code, i.e. synapse strength, is hard to read, so current computers cannot run that code yet.</p>

<p>Some brief details to add to the answer, though: the human visual cortex is arranged in layers that correspond to increasing layers of abstraction. In the eyes themselves, photons are detected by light-sensitive cells and added together to make what are essentially the color elements of pixels. Those are then routed to another layer which does something like edge detection, and then the next layer does something like shape detection, and so on up to higher level concepts like ""a cat's face.' If LSD lowers the activation threshold for those neurons, or makes them more excitable, then more things will be interpreted as having the higher level concept (and so a patch of rough texture may have a face jump out of it, for example).</p>

<p>The way that CNN ""deep dreaming' works is that the base image is amplified. That is, to make a particular patch look more like a dog, the shapes are nudged to be more dog-like, and the shapes nudge the edges, and the edges nudge the pixels.</p>

<p>A couple of points to elaborate on <a href=""http://ai.stackexchange.com/a/73/70"">Ben's answer</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is possible to generate different models (out of existing data!) and then look for the model that best fit new data (e.g. with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">knn</a>). Example: 

<ul>
<li>States = {<em>sleep</em>, <em>eat</em>, <em>walk</em>, <em>work</em>}</li>
<li>Model 1: Most probable sequence on weekdays, say: sleep → sleep → eat → walk → work → work → eat → walk → sleep  → sleep</li>
<li>Model 2: Most probable sequence on weekends, some: sleep → sleep → eat → walk → eat → walk → sleep → sleep</li>
<li>New data arrives: Which sequence is more probable that it came from? Check model 1, check model 2. Which fits better? → Assign</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Note that the previous example is oversimplified. Also note that a <em>unit time</em> is needed there (other than letters / words, for instance).</li>
<li>You can <em>nest</em> Markov models. That means that you generate a model (a set of probabilities for all the states) in a ""lower scale"" and then use it in a more abstract model. For example, you can nest your day-scale model to a month or year (to include holidays, for instance).</li>
</ul>

<p>As for the question if artificial intelligence can be created by using this kind of methods, my personal (easy) answer would be <strong>no</strong>, because they only relate data and probabilities and thus belong more to the statistics and machine learning branch. </p>

<p>If your AI program is so smart, ask it to take the general IQ tests for humans. Because the real IQ tests are made of several questions from different areas, so in that way you can measure IQ of your AI.</p>

<p>This is because the <strong>IQ</strong> means the tests which are <strong>designed</strong> to assess human intelligence.</p>

  <p>An intelligence quotient (IQ) is a total score derived from one of several standardized tests designed to assess human intelligence.<sup><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient"" rel=""nofollow"">wiki</a></sup></p>

<p>So there is no any other way of measuring IQ without taking IQ test, otherwise it won't be IQ (very logical).</p>

<p>If your program is not so smart, you should look for specific tests related to the expertise or problem being solved. Ideally let it compete with humans who has the same expertise in that area, but it's important make the test on the same ground/level.</p>

<p>This doesn't seem right to me.</p>

<p>Unsupervised learning models instead learn a <em>structure</em> from the data. A clustering model, for example, is learning both how many clusters exist in the data (a number that's not the same type as the inputs) and where those clusters are located (which is also a different type from the inputs). The output of running this model on a new datapoint <em>x</em> is not the same type as <em>x</em>, but instead a classification label.</p>

<p>Similarly, time series models learn parameters that symbolize how vectors in the input relate to each other, rather than raw inputs themselves.</p>

<p>As for how they learn, the structures are mathematical objects whose fitness is determined by the input data.

Most of our promising approaches deal with <em>avoiding damage</em> rather than <em>adding capabilities</em>--there's no drug that you can take now that will make you smarter to the degree that missing a night of sleep can make you dumber.</p>

<p>The most informative area of current practice is probably game-playing, where '<a href=""http://bloomreach.com/2014/12/centaur-chess-brings-best-humans-machines/"">centaurs</a>,' or humans working with computers, outcompete human players or computer players.</p>

<p>But a centaur player doesn't have a wire jutting out of their skull to jack into the computer; they're looking at a laptop screen. One of the reasons to be pessimistic about cyborg augmentation is because current I/O technology is already so good. Why install a new wire to put information into your visual cortex, when you come already equipped with two? </p>

<p>If you could think code directly onto the screen, how much better would that be than typing code through a keyboard? Probably some, but I find it difficult to imagine that it'll be more than twice as good. So most human-computer intelligence augmentation will look like people using software, and software using human inputs, rather than humans and computers evolving together.</p>

<hr>

<p>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (TDCS) and similar approaches cause temporary changes in mental abilities by raising or lowering the activation potentials of neurons in particular regions of the brain. (I've done it myself, a few years ago, and what weak effects I noticed were probably negative. Not too much surprise for a DIY setup!)</p>

<p>It looks like it has a number of useful implications. One article about TDCS that I found particularly striking was the journalist who tried it gushing about how their anxiety disappeared for a few days, presumably because the part of their brain behind the anxiety was dampened. One could imagine it being useful for the treatment of many different mental disorders.</p>

<p>That said, I'm pessimistic that it will translate into superior <em>peak</em> performance, and I think that's the sort of thing that's more relevant for discussions of augmentation. (Is there TDCS that we could do that would make Terrence Tao better at doing mathematics?)</p>

<p>Where improved AI methods will come into play is by improving our models of the brain, allowing us to better target interventions, much in the way that AI methods are improving our treatment of cancer (through superior diagnosis and targeting of radiotherapy, as two easy examples). These effects will all be indirect--for example, AI empowering an app or gadget that helps you sleep better won't <em>directly</em> augment your intelligence, but will cause population-level increases in effective intelligence through reducing sleep deprivation.</p>

<p>I haven't talked yet about nootropics, chemicals that increase intelligence, but it's reasonable to expect that AI will improve drug discovery there like it improves drug discovery for anything else. But the same caveats apply--the effect of nootropics seem to be negatively correlated with intelligence (that is, the smarter someone already is, the harder it is to increase their intelligence further).</p>

226,226,,,"<p>A genetic algorithm is an algorithm that randomly generates a number of attempted solutions for a problem. This set of attempted solutions is called the ""population"".  </p>

<p>It then tries to see how well these solutions solve the problem, using a given <em>fitness function</em>. The attempted solutions with the best <em>fitness</em> value are used to generate a new population.

<p>The idea is that, over time, an attempted solution emerges that has a high enough <em>fitness</em> value to solve the problem.</p>

<p>Suppose you were trying to find a polynomial that passes through a number of points. Your attempted solutions would be random polynomials.<br>

227,227,,,"<p>Evolutionary algorithms are a family of optimization algorithms based on the principle of <strong>Darwinian natural selection</strong>. As part of natural selection, a given environment has a population of individuals that compete for survival and reproduction. The ability of each individual to achieve these goals determines their chance to have children, in other words to pass on their genes to the next generation of individuals, who for genetic reasons will have an increased chance of doing well, even better, in realizing these two objectives. </p>

<p>This principle of continuous improvement over the generations is taken by evolutionary algorithms to optimize solutions to a problem. In the <strong>initial generation</strong>, a population composed of different <strong>individuals</strong> is generated randomly or by other methods. An individual is a solution to the problem, more or less good: the quality of the individual in regards to the problem is called <strong>fitness</strong>, which reflects the adequacy of the solution to the problem to be solved. The higher the fitness of an individual, the higher it is likely to pass some or all of its genotype to the individuals of the next generation.</p>

<p>An individual is coded as a <strong>genotype</strong>, which can have any shape, such as a** bit vector (<strong>genetic algorithms</strong>) or a vector of real (evolution strategies). Each genotype is transformed into a <strong>phenotype</strong> when assessing the individual, i.e. when its fitness is calculated. In some cases, the phenotype is identical to the genotype: it is called <strong>direct</strong> <strong>coding</strong>. Otherwise, the coding is called indirect. For example, suppose you want to optimize the size of a rectangular parallelepiped defined by its length, height and width. To simplify the example, assume that these three quantities are integers between 0 and 15. We can then describe each of them using a 4-bit binary number. An example of a potential solution may be to genotype 0001 0111 01010. The corresponding phenotype is a parallelepiped of length 1, height 7 and width 10.</p>

<p>During the transition from the old to the new generation are called <strong>variation</strong> <strong>operators</strong>, whose purpose is to manipulate individuals. There are two distinct types of variation operators:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <strong>mutation</strong> <strong>operators</strong>, which are used to introduce variations within the same individual, as genetic mutations;</li>
<li>the <strong>crossover</strong> <strong>operators</strong>, which are used to cross at least two different genotypes, as genetic crosses from breeding.</li>
</ul>

<p>Evolutionary algorithms have proven themselves in various fields such as operations research, robotics, biology, nuance, or cryptography. In addition, they can optimize multiple objectives simultaneously and can be used as black boxes because they do not assume any properties in the mathematical model to optimize. Their only real limitation is the computational complexity.</p>

228,228,,,"<p>As observed in another answer, all you need to apply Genetic Algorithms (GAs) is to represent a potential solution to your problem in a form that is subject to crossover and mutation. Ideally, the fitness function will provide some kind of smooth feedback about the quality of a solution, rather than simply being a 'Needle in a Haystack'.</p>

<p>Here are some characteristics of problems that Genetic Algorithms (and indeed <a href=""https://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/book/metaheuristics/"" rel=""nofollow"">Metaheuristics</a> in general) are good for:</p>

<ul>
<li>NP-complete - The number of possible solutions to the problem is
exponential, but checking the fitness of a solution is relatively
cheap (technically, with time polynomial in the input size). </li>
<li>Black box - GAs work reasonably well even if you don't have a particularly
informed model of the problem to be solved. This means that these
approaches are also useful as a 'rapid prototyping' approach to
solving problems.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, despite their widespread use for the purpose, note that GAs are actually <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.161.5655"" rel=""nofollow""><em>not</em> function optimizers</a> - GA mechanisms tend not to explore 'outlying' regions of the search space in the hope of finding some distant high quality solution, but rather to cluster around more easily attainable peaks in the 'fitness landscape'.</p>

229,229,,,"<p>This answer requests a practical example of how one might be used, which I will attempt to provide in addition to the other answers. They seem to due a very good job of explaining what a genetic algorithm is. So, this will give an example.</p>

<p>Let's say you have a neural network (although they are not the only application of it), which, from some given inputs, will yield some outputs. A genetic algorithm can create a population of these, and by seeing which output is the best, breed and kill off members of the population. Eventually, this should optimise the neural network if it is complicated enough. </p>

<p>Here is a demonstration I've made, which despite being badly coded, might help you understand. <a href=""http://khrabanas.github.io/projects/evo/evo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://khrabanas.github.io/projects/evo/evo.html</a>
Hit the evolve button and mess around with the goals.</p>

<p>It uses a simple genetic algorithm to breed, mutate and decide between which of the population survive. Depending on how the input variables are set, the network will be able to get to some level of closeness to them.In this fashion, wthe population will likely eventually become a homogenenous group, whose outputs resemble the goals.</p>

<p>The genetic algorithm is trying to create a ""neural network"" of sorts, that by taking in RGB, will yield an output color. First it generates a random population. It then by taking 3 random members from the population, selecting the one with the lowest fitness and removing it from the population. The fitness is equal to the difference in the top goal squared + the difference in the bottom goal squared. It then breeds the two remaining ones together and adds the child to the same place in the population as the dead member.
When mating occurs, there is a chance a mutation will occur. This mutation will change one of the values randomly.</p>

<p>As a side note, due to how it is set up, it is impossible for it to be totally correct in many cases, though it will reach relative closeness.</p>

<p>Images that are actually random junk were correctly recognized as nothing meaningful:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In response to an unrecognizable image, the networks could have output a low confidence for each of the 1000 classes, instead of an extremely high confidence value for one of the classes. In fact, they do just that for randomly generated images (e.g. those in generation 0 of the evolutionary run)</p>

<p>The original goal of the researchers was to use the neural networks to automatically generate images that look like the real things (by getting the recognizer's feedback and trying to change the image to get a more confident result), but they ended up creating the above art. Notice how even in the static-like images there are little splotches - usually near the center - which, it's fair to say, are triggering the recognition.</p>

<p>A good example of a declarative programming language is Prolog, which is based upon predicate logic. Here is a simple Prolog program:</p>

<pre><code>dog(brutus).
dog(pluto).
dog(X):-barks(X).

<p>This program states (declares) 3 things: (1) that brutus is dog, (2) that pluto is a dog, and (3) that if something is a dog, it barks.<br>
(Note that the names of the dogs are in small letters; Prolog uses capital letters to identify variables).</p>

<p>We can now ask this program to tell us who barks:</p>

<pre><code>barks(X)
</code></pre>

<p>and it will give us the solutions:</p>

<pre><code>X = brutus ;
X = pluto ;
no more solutions

249,249,,,"<p>The following post has a bit of math, which I hope helps to explain the problem better. Unfortunately it seems, this SE site does not support LaTex:</p>

<p>Document summarization is very much an open problem in AI research. One way this task is currently handled is called ""extractive summarization"". The basic strategy is as follows: Split this document into sentences and we will present as a summary a subset of sentences which together cover all the important details in the post. Assign sentence i, 1&lt;=i&lt;=n, a variable z_i \in {0,1}, where z_i = 1 indicates the sentence was selected and z_i = 0 means the sentence was left out. Then, z_i z_j = 1 if and only if both sentences were chosen. We will also define the importance of each sentence w_i for sentence i and interaction terms w_{ij} between sentences i and j. </p>

<p>Let x_i be the feature vectors for sentence i. w_i = w(x_i) captures how important it is to include this sentence (or the topics covered by it) while w_ij = w(x_i,x_j) indicates the amount of overlap between sentences in our summary. Finally we put all this in a minimization problem:</p>

<p>maximize_{z_i} \sum_{i} w_i z_i - w_{ij} z_i z_j 
s.t. z_i = 0 or 1</p>

<p>This tries to maximize the total weight of the sentences covered and tries to minimize the amount of overlap. This is an integer programming problem similar to finding the lowest weight independent set in a graph and many techniques exist to solve such problems.</p>

<p>This design, in my opinion, captures the fundamental problems in text summarization and can be extended in many ways. We will discuss those in a bit, but first we need to completely specify the features w. w_i = w(x_i) could be a function only of the sentence i, but it could also depends on the place of the sentence in the document or its context (Is the sentence at the beginning of a paragraph? Does it share common words with the title? What is its length? Does it mention any proper nouns? etc)</p>

<p>w_ij = w(x_i,x_j) is a similarity measure. It measures how much repetition there will be if we include both words in the sentence. It can be defined by looking at common words between sentences. We can also extract topics or concepts from each sentence and see how many are common between them, and use language features like pronouns to see if one sentence expands on another.</p>

<p>To improve the design, first, we could do <em>keyphrase extraction</em>, i.e. identify key phrases in the text and choose to define the above problem in terms of those instead of trying to pick sentences. That is a similar problem to what Google does to summarize news articles in their search results, but I am not aware of the details of their approach. We could also break the sentences up further into concepts and try to establish the semantic meaning of the sentences ( Ponzo and Fila are people P1 and P2, a mall is a place P, P1 and P2 went to the place P at time T (day). Mode of transport walking.... and so on). To do this, we would need to use a semantic ontology or other common-sense knowledge database. However, all the parts of this last semantic classification problem are open and I have not seen anyone make satisfactory progress on it yet. </p>

<p>We could also tweak the loss function above so that instead of the setting the tradeoff between the sentence importance w_i and the diversity score w_ij by hand, we could learn it from data. One way to do this is to use Conditional Random Fields to model the data, but many others surely exist.</p>

<p>I hope this answer explained the basic problems that need to be solved to make progress towards good summarization systems.

<p>Two similar but incompatible versions of Python are in widespread use (2 and 3). Please consider mentioning the version and implementation that you are using when asking a question about Python.</p>

<p>Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming styles. It features a fully dynamic type system and automatic memory management, similar to that of <a href=""/questions/tagged/scheme"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;scheme&#39;"" rel=""tag"">scheme</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/ruby"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ruby&#39;"" rel=""tag"">ruby</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/perl"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;perl&#39;"" rel=""tag"">perl</a> and <a href=""/questions/tagged/tcl"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;tcl&#39;"" rel=""tag"">tcl</a>.</p>

<p>Like other <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language"" rel=""nofollow"">dynamic languages</a>, Python is often used as a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/tags/scripting/info"">scripting language</a>, but is also used in a wide range of non-scripting contexts. Using third-party tools, Python code can be packaged into standalone executable programs. Python interpreters are available for many operating systems.</p>

<p><a href=""/questions/tagged/cpython"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;cpython&#39;"" rel=""tag"">cpython</a>, the reference implementation of Python, is free and open source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its alternative implementations. There are a wide variety of implementations more suited for specific environments or tasks.</p>

<p>The philosophy of Python is succinctly formulated in <a href=""http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020"" rel=""nofollow""><em>The Zen of Python</em></a> written by Tim Peters, which can be revealed by issuing this command at the interactive interpreter:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import this
</code></pre>

<p>The documentation can also be accessed offline for your installation of Python in the following manner:</p>

<ol>
<li>Going into <code>Your_Python_install_dir/Doc</code>. There is a complete Python documentation present for the version of Python installed on your computer.</li>
<li>Running <code>pydoc x</code> or <code>python -m pydoc x</code> from the command prompt or terminal displays documentation for module <code>x</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Unlike many other languages Python uses an indentation based syntax and this may take some getting used to for programmers familiar with braces for syntax.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from __future__ import braces
  File ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 1
SyntaxError: not a chance
</code></pre>

<p>To help with the transition it is a recommendation to use a properly configured text-editor created for programmers or an IDE. Python comes with a basic IDE called <a href=""http://docs.python.org/2/library/idle.html"" rel=""nofollow"">IDLE</a> to get you started. Other popular examples are the charity-ware <a href=""/questions/tagged/vim"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;vim&#39;"" rel=""tag"">vim</a>, the free GNU <a href=""/questions/tagged/emacs"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;emacs&#39;"" rel=""tag"">emacs</a>, <a href=""/questions/tagged/eclipse"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;eclipse&#39;"" rel=""tag"">eclipse</a>+<a href=""/questions/tagged/pydev"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;pydev&#39;"" rel=""tag"">pydev</a> or <a href=""/questions/tagged/pycharm"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;pycharm&#39;"" rel=""tag"">pycharm</a>.

253,253,,,"<p>An important question that does not yet have a satisfactory answer in neural network research is how DNNs come up with the predictions they offer. DNNs effectively work (though not exactly) by matching patches in the images to a ""dictionary"" of patches, one stored in each neuron (see <a href=""http://research.google.com/archive/unsupervised_icml2012.html"">the youtube cat paper</a>). Thus, it may not have a high level view of the image since it only looks at patches, and images are usually downscaled to much lower resolution to obtain the results in current generation systems. Methods which look at how the components of the image interact may be able to avoid these problems.</p>

<p>Some questions to ask for this work are: How confident were the networks when they made these predictions? How much volume do such adversarial images occupy in the space of all images?</p>

<p>Some work I am aware of in this regard comes from Dhruv Batra and Devi Parikh's Lab at Virginia Tech who look into this for question answering systems: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.07356v1.pdf"">Analyzing the Behavior of Visual Question Answering Models</a> and <a href=""https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~dbatra/papers/gmpb_icmlvis16.pdf"">Interpreting Visual Question Answering models</a>. </p>

<p>More such work is needed, and just as the human visual system does also get fooled by such ""optical illusions"", these problems may be unavoidable if we use DNNs, though AFAIK nothing is yet known either way, theoretically or empirically. </p>

254,254,,,"<p>To have any chance at answering this, you'd first need a rigorous definition of ""true artificial intelligence"", which we don't have.  And even if you had that, the best answer would probably be ""nobody knows.""  We don't even understand exactly how human intelligence (which is probably the best model of intelligence we have available to study) works.  What we do know (or think we know) is that ANN's are at best a very superficial replica of brain function.  It may turn out that they're absolutely the wrong path to achieving ""true artificial intelligence"" although I expect most people would be surprised if that turned out to be the case.</p>

<p>What probably wouldn't be so surprising would be if some other technique emerged which is better than ANN's, OR if it turns out that you need an ensemble of techniques.  Personally I think it's close to self-evident that the brain works largely in a probabilistic fashion, but it's also clear that we do sometimes use symbolic processing / deductive logic / rules / etc.  And right now, ANN's don't give you much in the way of reasoning, deduction, etc.  So we may ultimately find that we have to combine a probabilistic approach like ANN's with other techniques - maybe Inductive Logic Programming or something of that nature. </p>

Thus, RBF neurons have maximum activation when the center/weights are equal to the inputs (look at the image below). Due to this property, RBF neural networks are good for novelty detection (if each neuron is centered on a training example, inputs far away from all neurons constitute novel patterns) but not so good at extrapolation. Also, RBFs may use backpropagation for learning, or hybrid approaches with unsupervised learning in the hidden layer (they usually have just 1 hidden layer).

Although that may seem counter-intuitive, at present we have no physical theory that allows us to detect consciousness (philosophically speaking, a <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">'Zombie'</a> is indistinguishable from a non-Zombie - see the writing of <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0316180661"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Daniel Dennett</a> and <a href=""http://consc.net/books/tcm/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">David Chalmers</a> for more on this).

<p>Also, note that 'destroy' doesn't necessarily mean the same for entities with <em>persistent substrate</em>, i.e. their 'brain state' can be reversibly serialized to some other storage medium and/or multiple copies of them can co-exist. So if by 'destroy' we simply mean 'switch off', then an AGI might conceivably be reassured of a subsequent re-awakening.

<p>The most logical reason why PHP is unsuited for neural networks is that PHP is, well, intended to be used for server side webpages. It can connect to various external resources, such as databases, via native language features. It is very much a glue language, and not a processing language. PHP is also mostly stateless, only allowing you to store state in either clients, file storage or databases.</p>

<p>As such, it's <strong>not</strong> suitable for this sort of thing - not because PHP is a high level language, but rather because it's so request based and focused towards creating pages to serve to clients.</p>

299,299,,,"<p>There are a number of good answers here explaining what genetic algorithms are, and giving example applications. I'm adding some general purpose advice on what they are good for, but also cases where you should NOT use them. If my tone seems harsh, it is because using GAs in any of the cases in the Not Appropriate section will lead to your paper being <em>instantly</em> rejected from any top-tier journal. </p>

<p>First, your problem MUST be an optimization problem. You need to define a ""fitness function"" that you are trying to optimize and you need to have a way to measure it.</p>

<p>Good: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Crossover functions are easy to define and natural</strong>: When dealing with certain kinds of data, crossover/mutation functions might be easy to define. For example strings (eg. DNA or gene sequences) can be mutated easily by splicing two candidate strings to obtain a new one (this is why nature uses genetic algorithms!). Trees (like phylogenetic trees or parse trees) can be spliced too, by replacing a branch of one tree with a branch from another. Shapes (like airplane wings or boat shapes) can be mutated easily by drawing a grid on the shape and combining different grid sections from the parents to obtain a child. Usually this means your problem is composed of different parts and putting together parts from distinct solutions is a valid candidate solution.

<ul>
<li>This means that if your problem is defined in a vector space where the coordinates don't have any special meaning, GAs are not a good choice. If it is hard to formulate your problem as a GA, it is not worth it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Black Box evaluation</strong>: If for a candidate, your fitness function is evaluated outside the computer, GAs are a good idea. For example, if you are testing a wing shape in an air tunnel, genetic algorithms will help you generate good candidate shapes to try. 

<ul>
<li><strong>Exception: Simulations</strong>. If your fitness function is measuring how well a nozzle design performs and requires simulating the fluid dynamics for each nozzle shape, GAs may work well for you. They may also work if you are simulating a physical system through time and are interested in how well your design performs over the course of the operation eg. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRthdBr46cs"" rel=""nofollow"">modelling locomotion patterns</a>. However, methods that use partial differential equations as constraints are being developed in the literature, eg. <a href=""https://www.siam.org/meetings/op08/Heinkenschloss.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">PDE constrained optimization</a>, so this may change in the future.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Not Appropriate:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>You can calculate a gradient</strong> for your function: If you have access to the gradient of your function, you can do gradient descent, which is in general much more efficient than GAs. Gradient descent may have issues with local minima (as will GAs) but many methods have been studied to mitigate this. </li>
<li><strong>You know the fitness function in closed form</strong>: Then, you can probably calculate the gradient. Many languages have libraries supporting <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation"" rel=""nofollow"">automatic differentiation</a>, so you don't even need to do it manually. If your function is not differentiable, then you can use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgradient_method"" rel=""nofollow"">subgradient descent</a>.</li>
<li>Your optimization problem is of a known form, like a <strong>linear program or a quadratic program</strong>: GAs (and black box optimization methods in general) are very inefficient in terms of the number of candidates they need to evaluate, and are best avoided if possible. </li>
<li><strong>Your solution space is small</strong>: If you can grid your search space efficiently, you can guarantee that you have found the best solution, and can make contour plots of the solution space to see if there is a region you need to explore further.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, if you are considering a GA, consider more recent work in Evolutionary Strategies. I am biased towards <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES"" rel=""nofollow"">CMA-ES</a>, which I think is a good simple algorithm that captures the notion of a gradient in the fitness landscape in a way that traditional GAs do not.</p>

<p>For example, the primary use of randomness in statistics is random assignment (A/B testing, randomized controlled trials, etc.). The reason to do this is to make the influence of confounders independent from the influence of the factor under investigation.</p>

<p>But randomness only works for this <em>in expectation</em>. If we actually knew what the confounders were, we could do a paired assignment (or a similar scheme) that ensured the various groups were matched <em>as well as possible</em>, instead of us just not knowing ahead of time which way the bias went.</p>

<hr>

<p>There are some cases where pseudorandomness, rather than full randomness, will impair training AI designs. A simple example would be a case where you want to randomly initialize weights in a network where the number of parameters exceeds the periodicity of the RNG; this means that while you have as many possible networks as there are possible unique seeds, you can't actually visit the entire weight space that you wanted to sample over.</p>

<p>I don't think any of those cases are limiting factors, however. Having truly random stochastic gradient descent instead of pseudorandom stochastic gradient descent doesn't seem like it would make a serious difference in the trajectory of AI designs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imagined speech (unspoken speech, silent speech, or covert speech) is
  the process by which one thinks about a word, or “hears” the word in
  one’s head, in the absence of any vocalization or physical movement
  indicating the word. Though there exists evidence that it is possible
  for imagined speech information to be captured and interpreted. To
  facilitate imagined speech, a Brain-to-Computer Interface (BCI) must
  be implemented to provide silent communication abilities directly
  between the two entities. One of the most popular methods for
  interfacing directly between a human brain and a computer is through
  electroencephalographic signals.</p>
  
  <p>Researchers have created models capable of achieving 70 - 90%
  predictive accuracy in recognizing patterns in EEG data;
  however, the accuracy of current methods for unspoken speech
  recognition is not yet sufficient to enable fluid communication
  between humans and machines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>High Level Experiment Design</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the subjects were asked to imagine a specific word or feeling (label).
  The subjects responded to a set of uniform verbal cues describing the
  set of labels as well as the desired individual label to imagine. The
  data was then processed in order to minimize the effects of irrelevant
  signal activity, or noise. Additionally the data was processed to
  minimize its volume while still maintaining the core “information” in
  the data. The condensed dataset was created by dropping irrelevant
  information from the EEG device and applying principal component
  analysis (PCA) to the video stream data. Once the data was processed
  and assembled into the correct format, cross-validation using a random
  forest algorithm was performed on the control group of EEG signals
  alone and on the hypothesis group consisting of both EEG and video
  data. The predictive accuracy measurements obtained from the
  cross-validation experiments were used as metrics to evaluate the
  success of the hypothesis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The results show a notable improvement classifying thoughts when in conjunction with the video streams.</p>

<p>To transcribe an excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>One can easily imagine that Asimov was smart enough to know this and was more interested in story-writing than designing real-world AI control protocols.</p>

Ray Kurzweil's impending <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity"">Singularity</a>, or the possibility of hyperintelligent AGIs otherwise, might not leave much of a possibility for humans to control AIs at all, leaving peer-regulation as the only feasible possibility.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Eliezer Yudkowsky and others ran an <a href=""http://www.yudkowsky.net/singularity/aibox/"">experiment</a> wherein Yudkowsky played the role of a superintelligent AI with the ability to speak, but no other connection outside of a locked box.

332,332,,,"<p>The answer to your question is ""In principle, yes"" - in it's most general form, EQ testing is just a specific case of the Turing test (""How would you feel about ... ?""). </p>

<p>To see why meaningful EQ tests might be difficult to achieve, consider the following two possible tests:</p>

<p>At one extreme of complexity, the film 'Blade Runner' famously shows a test to distinguish between human and android on the basis of responses to emotionally-charged questions.</p>

<p>If you tried asking these questions (or even much simpler ones) to a modern chatbot, you'd likely quickly conclude that you were not talking to a person.</p>

<p>The problem with assessing EQ is that the more emotionally sophisticated the test, the more general the AI system is likely have to be, in order to turn the input into a meaningful representation.</p>

<p>At the other extreme from the above, suppose that an EQ test was phrased in an extremely structured way, with the structured input provided by a human. In such a case, success at an 'EQ test' is not really grounded in the real-world.</p>

<p>In an essay entitled ""The ineradicable Eliza effect and its dangers"", Douglas Hofstadter gives the following example, in which the ACME program is claimed (not by Hofstadter) to 'understand' analogy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here the computer learns about a fellow named Sluggo taking his wife Jane and
  his good buddy Buck to a bar, where things take their natural course and Jane
  winds up pregnant by Buck. She has the baby but doesn't want it, and so, aided
  by her husband, she drowns the baby in a river, thus ""neatly solving ""the problem""
  of Bambi.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This story is presented to ACME in the following form:</p>

<pre><code>ql: (neglectful-husband (Sluggo))
q2: (lonely-and-sex-starved-wife (Jane-Doe))
q3: (macho-ladykiller (Buck-Stag))
q4: (poor-innocent-little-fetus (Bambi))
q5: (takes-out-to-local-bar (Sluggo Jane-Doe Buck-Stag))
...
q11: (neatly-solves-the-problem-of (Jane-Doe Bambi))
q12: (cause (ql0 q11))
</code></pre>

<p>Suppose the program were to be asked if Jane Doe's behavior was moral. Complex compound emotional concepts such as 'neglectful', 'lonely' and 'innocent' are here simply predicates, not available to the AI for deeper introspective examination. They could just as easily be replaced by labels such as as 'bling-blang-blong15657'. </p>

<p>So in one sense, the absence of success at an EQ test with any depth is indicative of the general problem currently facing AI: the inability to define (or otherwise learn) meaningful representations of subtle complexities of the human world, which is a lot more complex than being able to recognize videos of cats.</p>

334,334,,,"<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method"">Monte Carlo method</a> is an approach where you generate a large number of random values or simulations and form some sort of conlusions based on the general patterns, such as the means and variances.</p>

<p>As an example, you could use it for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_weather_prediction"">weather forecasts</a>. Predicting long-term weather is quite difficult, because it is a chaotic system where small changes can lead to very different results. Using Monte Carlo methods, you could run a large number of simulations, each with slightly different atmospheric changes. Then you can analyze the results and for example calculate the probability of rain on a given day based on how many simulations ended up with rain. </p>

<p>As for the use of Monte Carlo in Alpha Go, they seem to be using the so-called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search"">Monte Carlo Tree Search</a>. In this approach, you make a tree of possible moves, a few turns into the future, and try to find the best sequence. However, since the number of possible moves in the game of go is very large, you won't be able to explore very far ahead. This means that some of the moves which look good now might turn out to be bad later. </p>

<p>So, in the Monte Carlo Tree Search, you pick a promising sequence of moves and run one or more simulations of how the game might proceed from that point. Then you can use the results of that simulation to get a better idea of how good that specific sequence of moves really is and you update the tree accordingly. Repeat as needed until you find a good move.</p>

<p>Again, I'd argue not. The main reason for saying this is that our decision-making algorithms are simply not sufficiently context aware to be able to decide whether theft or harm is the intent.

  <p>The main reason why these are easily fooled is because Deep Neural Network does not see the world in the same way as human vision. We use the whole image to identify things while DNN depends on the features. As long as DNN detects certain features, it will classify the image as a familiar object it has been trained on.
  The researchers proposed one way to prevent such fooling by adding the fooling images to the dataset in a new class and training DNN on the enlarged dataset. In the experiment, the confidence score decreases significantly for ImageNet AlexNet. It is not easy to fool the retrained DNN this time. But when the researchers applied such method to MNIST LeNet, evolution still produces many unrecognizable images with confidence scores of 99.99%.</p>

386,386,,,"<p>This is something of an orthogonal answer, but I think Brooks didn't go about his idea the right way. That is, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsumption_architecture"" rel=""nofollow"">subsumption architecture</a> is one in which the 'autopilot' is <em>replaced</em> by a more sophisticated system when necessary. (All pieces receive the raw sensory inputs, and output actions, some of which turn off or on other systems.)</p>

<p>But a better approach is the normal hierarchical control approach, in which the target of a lower level system is the output of a higher level system. That is, the targeted joint angle of a robot leg is determined by the system that is trying to optimize the velocity, which is determined by a system that is trying to optimize the trajectory, which is determined by a system that is trying to optimize the target position, and so on.</p>

<p>This allows for increasing level of complexity while maintaining detail and system reusability.</p>

<hr>

<p>That said, I don't think you actually need what one would naively call 'embodied cognition' in order to get the bottom-up hierarchy of competencies that Brooks is right to point towards. The core feature is the wide array of inputs and outputs, which are understood in a hierarchical fashion that allows systems to be chained together vertically. I think you could get a functional general intelligence whose only inputs and outputs involve going through an Ethernet cable, and doesn't have anything like a traditional body that it actuates or senses through. (This is a claim that the hierarchical structure is what matters, not the content of what we use that structure for.)</p>

<ul>
<li>Success in transfer learning is very limited. </li>
<li>The 'hard problem' (i.e. presenting the 'raw, unwashed environment' to the machine and having it come up with a solution from scratch) is not being

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Machine learning and reasoning.</strong></p>

<p>Currently AI systems use supervised learning using huge amount of dataset of labeled data for training. This is very different to how humans learn by creating concepts, relationship, common sense reasoning which gives ability to learn much without too much data. Therefore machine learning with common-sense reasoning capabilities should be researched further more.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Decision techniques.</strong></p>

<p>Current AI-based systems have very limited ability for making decisions, therefore new techniques must be developed (e.g. modeling systemic risks, analyzing tradeoffs, detecting anomalies in context, analyzing data while preserving privacy).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Domain-specific AI systems.</strong></p>

<p>The current AI-based system is lack of abilities to understand the variety of domains of human expertise (such as medicine, engineering, law and many more). The systems should be able to perform professional-level tasks such as designing problems, experiments, managing contradictions, negotiating, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data assurance and trust.</strong></p>

<p>The current AI-based systems require huge amounts of data and their behaviour directly depends on the quality of this data which can be biased, incomplete or compromised. This can be expensive and time consuming especially where it is used for safety critical systems which potentially can be very dangerous.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Radically efficient computing infrastructure.</strong></p>

<p>The current AI-based systems require unprecedented workloads and computing power which require development of new computing architectures (such as neuromorphic).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interpretability and explanations.</strong></p>

<p>For people to follow AI suggestions, they need to trust systems, and this is only when they are capable of knowing users' intents, priorities, reasoning and they can learn from their mistakes. These capabilities are required in many business domains and professionals</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Value alignment and ethics.</strong></p>

<p>Humans can share the common knowledge of how the world function, the machine cannot. They can fail by having unintended and unexpected behaviour only because humans did not specify the right goals for them or them omitted essential training details. The systems should be able to correct specification of the goals and avoid unintended and undesired consequences in the behaviour.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Social AI.</strong></p>

<p>The AI-based systems should be able to work closely to humans in their professional and personal life, therefore they should have significant social capabilities, because they can impact on our emotions and our decision making capabilities. Also sophisticated natural language capabilities will need to be developed to allow a natural interaction and dialog between humans and machines.</p></li>

407,407,,,"<p>One way of illustrating the deficiencies of many of our current approaches <em>at once</em> is to consider how well it is possible to represent (equivalently, learn) commonsense knowledge. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Babar wonders how he can get new clothing. Luckily, a very rich old man who has always been fond of little elephants understands right away that he is longing for a fine suit.</p>

409,409,,,"<p>There has been quite a few approaches to achieve such kind of distributed coordination. I present here one of them, for its generality and simplicity (that makes it easy to remember too). But first, the general idea behind these approaches is pretty interesting, around a mechanism called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy"">stigmergy</a>.</p>

<p>Stigmergy is a behaviour coordination mechanism mediated by the environment. It was first described for termites, and the most famous example pertains to ants. Ants form trails when going out for food, but they often do not interact <em>directly</em>. It turns out they leave pheromones on the ground as they walk away from their hills. The pheromone allows them to find their way home, and it also guides where they are going: If they find a pheromone trace from one of their peers, they follow it and their own pheromones <em>add up</em>, reinforcing the signal of the trail. In stage, more and more ants get ""together as they move"", forming a trail. Coordination has been achieved.</p>

<p>Among the various implementation derived from stigmergy, there is the ""field-based motion coordination model"" (FBMCM). The idea is to create a (maybe virtual) environment that maintains some states of the world. Each object registers in the environment a signal that is maximum at the object position (its edges) and then decreases with distance. Moving objects (e.g. robots) each emit a signal relayed by the environment. They can then sense each other's field and act accordingly: E.g., when signals are strong, move away; when weak, it is safe to get closer, etc. Several complex group moves have been demonstrated in software simulators (platoon formation in games, drill simulations) and with robots. The benefit of this approach is that it can be cheap to compute even complex behaviours. For example, avoiding clashes requires simple ""logic"" code based on summing-up nearby fields value. FBMCM is pretty slick, used in video-games, but hard to implement in physical settings (to my <em>dating</em> knowledge), as it can be challenging to build a reliable environment. See for example the work from <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2949751_Field-based_Motion_Coordination_In_Quake_3_Arena"">Mamei and Zambonelli</a>, as well as one of the first industrial implementations for robots by <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221456459_Decentralized_control_of_E%27GV_transportation_systems"">Weyns et al.</a>. Note that the implementation for robots required significant work on the environment infrastructure, made somewhat more feasible as it was a controlled warehouse.</p>

<p>The advantage of stigmergy-like models is that they are often <em>simple</em> and <em>resilient</em>: You can lose an ant without impact on the food-finding trail. On the downside, these models are usually <em>slow</em>, as the coordination takes time to emerge from indirect interactions. This can be improved upon by adding extra direct interactions (e.g. empowering ants with a GPS and a grocery store map, or just a magnetic-North sense).</p>

<p>In practice, these models can collapse if the environment implementation is not reliable. It can be difficult for robots or, say, self-driving cars, if they expect some transponders put on their way, as these devices are expensive to set and maintain, and they can be broken or stolen. It would be better to endow robots with radars, sonars or other proximity sensors to implement stigmergic models. One related example is the decision by Tesla to add radars to its cars, instead of assuming reliable transponders on the road (<em>note</em>: This is just a parallel; there is no official relation).</p>

<p>Other implementations and related models are, for example, tuple-based coordination languages such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_(coordination_language)"">Linda</a>, and network protocols like <a href=""https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/chord:sigcomm01/chord_sigcomm.pdf"">Chord</a>.

<li><p>Cognitive Science, Psychology, Cognitive Linguistics. The reasons here are obvious.</p></li>

<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering"" rel=""nofollow"">Software Engineering</a>: Assuming we find a good model for AI, how do you make it? This is what the engineer will want to figure out. And it can be hard to map mathematical models to an engineered piece.</li>
<li>Statistics and Probabilities (more specific than just Mathematics, which is also close to Computer Science): This is about Data Science, notably as a foundation to Machine Learning, the most active branch in AI---which ""just"" covers the <em>learning</em> part.</li>
<li>Physics: This is particularly relevant now for hardware (see below).</li>
<li>Neuro Science: Understand how the brain works, as an inspiration to create an artificial one, is the home for Connectionists. Recently, Hassabis and his team at Google Deepmind made several breakthroughs related to reinforcement learning, memory, attention, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Recently Electric Engineering is getting a lot of light, together with the related branches of Physics. Several public and private laboratories focus on ""brain chips"". To name a few: IBM (who's working on that for some time already), Nvidia, and Facebook. Circa 2010, it became clear that techniques like deep learning require horsepower, thus an increasing focus on creating more powerful, smaller, more energy efficient chips. And on top of that, there is all the work in Quantum Computing.</p>

<p>But the thing is, there seems to be many more fields that are getting involved in AI research. We should mention Chemistry and Biology, as both inspiration and tools to make new models or hardware (e.g. chips that do not use silicon, so they can get smaller).</p>

<p>As for 2016, the above fields are the most active, and promise to remain very active for quite some time. Pick your own depending on your interest, skills, or mere intuition!</p>

417,417,2095.0,1.0,"<p>In October 2014, Dr. Mark Riedl published an approach to testing AI intelligence, called <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.6142v3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">the ""Lovelace Test 2.0""</a>, after being inspired by the <a href=""http://kryten.mm.rpi.edu/lovelace.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">original Lovelace Test</a> (published in 2001). Mark believed that the original Lovelace Test would be impossible to pass, and therefore, suggested a weaker, and more practical version.</p>

<p>The Lovelace Test 2.0 makes the assumption that for an AI to be intelligent, it must exhibit creativity. From the paper itself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Lovelace 2.0 Test is as follows: artificial agent a is challenged as follows:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>a must create an artifact o of type t;</p></li>
  <li><p>o must conform to a set of constraints C where ci ∈ C is
  any criterion expressible in natural language;</p></li>
  <li><p>a human evaluator h, having chosen t and C, is satisfied
  that o is a valid instance of t and meets C; and</p></li>
  <li><p>a human referee r determines the combination of t and C
  to not be unrealistic for an average human.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Since it is possible for a human evaluator to come up with some pretty easy constraints for an AI to beat, the human evaluator is then expected to keep coming up with more and more complex constraints for the AI until the AI fails. The point of the Lovelace Test 2.0 is to <em>compare</em> the creativity of different AIs, not to provide a definite dividing line between 'intelligence' and 'nonintelligence' like the Turing Test would.</p>

<p>However, I am curious about whether this test has actually been used in an academic setting, or it is only seen as a thought experiment at the moment. The Lovelace Test seems easy to apply in academic settings (you only need to develop some measurable constraints that you can use to test the artificial agent), but it also may be too subjective (humans can disagree on the merits of certain constraints, and whether a creative artifact produced by an AI actually meets the final result).</p>

418,418,,,"<p>Yes, although how useful this AI can be is another question entirely.</p>

<p><strong>mpgac</strong> is a ""minimally intelligent AGI"" trained on the GAC-80K corpus of MIST questions. As a result, it should be able to ""minimally"" pass this test. However, being trained on the GAC-80K corpus obviously make it lacking for any practical purposes. From the README:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Obviously this should only be capable of producing a minimally intelligent signal when ordinary commonsense questions are asked, of the kind depicted above, using questions which would have made sense to an average human between the years 2000 and 2005. On expert knowledge or current affairs related questions it should perform no better than chance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The point of mpgac is to compare it to other AIs that could be built to pass this test. Or as the writer wrote in the README:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When scanning the skies how can we tell whether the radio signals detected are from an intelligent source, or are merely just background or sensor noise?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ideally, you would want to build a program that is ""better"" than mpgac. In much the same way as ELIZA can be seen as a baseline for the Turing Test, mpgac is the baseline for the MIST test.</p>

422,422,,,"<p>In AI (but in general too, I believe), a simplification is that modeling is more akin to Mathematics (and related hard sciences involved, like Physics and... Computer Science), and implementation to Software Engineering.</p>

<p>Let's take a concrete example, really outside of AI: Find the minimum value of a given polynomial, if it exists.</p>

<p>The Mathematician will derivate the polynomial, find the zeros, and checkout convexity to find a minimum (if there is any zero). This procedure is very standard---some will say straightforward. It relies on a body of knowledge and an abstraction level that is appropriate for manual proof.</p>

<p>The Software Engineer approach is actually way longer to explain, and I am going to skip it. The point is that the body of knowledge is related but different: We have to find now a step-by-step procedure for the computer to achieve the result. The Mathematician one could be implemented directly in MathLab, almost verbatim, but we <em>assume</em> MathLab. And to build MathLab, we are back to the problem of making a procedure the computer can execute. We could for example base a procedure on Euler's method to find roots (a ""simple"" approach that closes on roots step after step), etc.</p>

<p>Simple mathematical operations can be quite complex to implement on a computer. Perhaps the most famous is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation"" rel=""nofollow"">random-number generation</a>. Mathematically, the concept is pure and clear. Generating an actual random-number is more elusive than it looks, to the point it calls for new <em>models</em> and new <em>implementations</em>...</p>

<p>A concrete example from history: Neural networks. In the 80s and 90s, NNs were weighted graphs that could be executed on computers using graph libraries or similar foundation libs. Choosing the weights was challenging. One day the back-propagation learning model was introduced to automated the choice of weights. The model relied on a procedure dedicated to NNs, using a terminology like partial derivates, gradient descent, chain rules, etc. And later then, clever engineers created libraries to automate the back-propagation procedure. The libraries can be somewhat far from the original model, as engineers learn how to make it computable, even faster (i.e. optimization, approximations/truncations).</p>

<p>A.) If all I want is an AI with a very limited vocabulary where the generate text should be short sentences following a basic pattern.</p>

<p><em>I like yellow fields with some trees</em></p>

<p><em>I like big cities with lots of bars</em></p>

<p>...</p>

<p>B.) If the dataset really needs to be that big. What if I just repeat the text over and over to reach the recommended minimum? If that would work though, I'd be wondering how that is any different from just taking more iterations of learning with the same shorter text?</p>

<p>Obviously I can play with these two questions myself and in fact I am experimenting with it. One thing I already figured out is that with a shorter text following a basic pattern I can get to a very very low ( ~0.04) quite fast but the predicted text just turns out as gibberish.</p>

<p>My naive explanation for that would be that there are just not enough samples to proof against whether the gibberish actually makes sense or not? But then again I wonder if more iterations or duplicating the content would actually help.</p>

Short version: yes, we know what went wrong, but probably not how to fix it yet.</p>

<p>Basically, AlphaGo is good at making lots of small decisions well, and managing risk and uncertainty better than humans can. One of the things that's surprising about it relative to previous bots that play Go is how good it was at tactical fights; in previous games, Lee had built a position that AlphaGo needed to attack, and then AlphaGo successfully attacked it.</p>

<p>So in this game, Lee played the reverse strategy. Instead of trying to win many different influence battles, where AlphaGo had already shown it was stronger than him, he would set up one critical battle (incurring minor losses along the way), and then defeat it there, with ripple events that would settle the match in his favor.</p>

<p>So what's the weakness of AlphaGo that allowed that to work? As I understand it, this is a fundamental limitation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). MCTS works by randomly sampling game trees and averaging them; if 70% of games from a particular position go well and 30% of games from another position go well, then you should probably play the first move instead of the second move.</p>

<p>But when there's a specific sequence of plays that go well--if, say, W has a path that requires them playing exactly the right stone each time, but B has no possible response to this path--then MCTS breaks down, because you can only find that narrow path through minimax reasoning, and moving from the slower minimax reasoning to the faster MCTS is one of the big reasons why bots are better now than they were in the past.</p>

<p>It's unclear how to get around this. There may be a way to notice this sort of threat, and then temporarily switch from MCTS reasoning to minimax reasoning, or to keep around particular trajectories in memory for consideration in future plays. </p>

Face paintings   would be your best bet since they can be easily changed, tattoos not so much. Once somebody has a photo of your face with your tattoo on it, you're busted.  Glasses will work if they're opaque and hide your eyes (sunglasses). The facial recognition software does not recognize jewelry, as it's tiny, and very easy to remove and put on. Ideally you want to have your face professionally made up with makeup and fake skin (basically a fake face).</p>

<p>Regarding VGDL, as far as I can see, the main site associated with it is gvgai.net, which is currently down. The associated API is described <a href=""http://julian.togelius.com/Perez20152014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">in this paper</a>.</p>

<p>Percept state for GVGAI is more structured than for ALE, but the closest correspondence to ALE appears to be an 'Observation grid', consisting of a 2D array of sprite identifiers.</p>

<p>Actions: ACTION_NIL, ACTION_UP, ACTION_LEFT, ACTION_DOWN, ACTION_RIGHT and ACTION_USE (stated as 'typical' values). </p>

<p>Of the two, it would seem that ALE is more suitable for AGI, because of the more 'free form' nature of the input.</p>

<p>However, one of the issues with <em>either</em> of these approaches is that the set of possible actions is strongly constrained. These domains are therefore 'operationalised' - the hard task of working out what actions are possible has already been solved for the AI by the API, effectively acting as a bottleneck on the complexity of mapping from input to output.</p>

<p>A range of alternative game-playing frameworks are listed <a href=""http://cig16.image.ece.ntua.gr/competitions/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and one alternative (which I personally believe is more useful for AGI purposes) is the <a href=""http://atkrye.github.io/IEEE-CIG-Text-Adventurer-Competition/"" rel=""nofollow"">Artificial Text Adventurer</a>, in which (at each turn) agent is presented with natural language input describing the scene and must then output a command in natural language.

  <p>We define AI as the study of agents that <strong>receive percepts from the 
  environment and perform actions</strong>. Each such agent implements a function
  that maps percept sequences to actions, and we cover different ways to
  represent these functions, such as reactive agents, real-time
  planners, and decision-theoretic systems. We explain the role of
  learning as extending the reach of the designer into
  unknown environments, and we show how that role constrains agent
  design, favoring explicit knowledge representation and reasoning.</p>

<p><a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/9332543518"">Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach - Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig</a></p>

<p>So the example you cite, ""autopilot for cars/planes"", is actually a (famous) form of AI as it has to <strong>use a form of knowledge representation to deal with unknown environments and circumstances</strong>. Ultimately, these systems also collect data so that the knowledge representation can be updated to deal with the new inputs that they have found. They do this with <a href=""http://fortune.com/2015/10/16/how-tesla-autopilot-learns/"">autopilot for cars</a> all the time</p>

<p>So, directly to your question, for something to be considered as ""having AI"", <strong>it needs to be able to deal with unknown environments/circumstances in order to achieve its objective/goal</strong>, and render knowledge in a manner that provides for new learning/information to be added easily. There are many different types of well defined knowledge representation methods, ranging from the popular <a href=""http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/"">neural net</a>, through to probabilistic models like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network"">bayesian networks (belief networks)</a> - but fundamentally actions by the system must be derived from whichever representation of knowledge you choose for it to be considered as AI.</p>

<p><em>Warning: I cannot find again the source critical to the next paragraph, and reading again pages over pages, I cannot find similar argument in other reports. I still remember vividly the point below, but please keep in mind it may be incorrect. The rest of the answer is weakly related, so I leave it all, with this warning.</em></p>

<p>An independent report (link needed, I can't find it...) explained that the assistive system was unable to detect the truck due to an exceptionally low contrast (bright sky perceived as white---colour of the truck). The report also said that a human driver would have been unable to make the difference either. In other words, it is possible that car sensors (presumably camera) and the human eye could not have detected an obstacle, and could not have triggered any safety measure. This <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/07/01/business/inside-tesla-accident.html"" rel=""nofollow"">short graphical explanation</a> sums up the car sensors: Camera, radar, GPS, etc.</p>

<p>The assistive sub-system is based on proprietary AI technologies. We can <em>only speculate</em> under some hypothesis. _This is not very useful, honestly, except for <strong>illustration purpose</strong>. Assuming the assistive system relies on ML technologies to learn about obstacles from a video stream (such systems do exist):</p>

<ul>
<li>It may be that the learning data was not ""good enough"" to cover the truck scenario.</li>
<li>It may be the technology was not powerful enough yet (lack generalization power, or simply too slow).</li>
<li>It may be a hardware problem, notably from the sensors: If the ""car's eyes"" are defective, the ""car's brain"" (the assistive system) is unable to react properly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why those technologies did not work in that case will remain a secret. We can say however that <em>any system</em>---whether built with AI technology or not---has limits. Beyond these limits, the system reaction is unpredictable: It could stop, reset, shutdown. The difficulty here is to define what a ""default behaviour"" is. A machine will basically do whatever it is designed to do, so an AI-based system too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Boltzmann machines can be seen as the stochastic, generative counterpart of Hopfield nets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both are recurrent neural networks that can be trained to learn of bit patterns. Then when presented with a partial pattern, the net will retrieve the full complete pattern.</p>

<p>Hopfield networks have been proven to have a capacity of 0.138 (e.g. approximately 138 bit vectors can be recalled from storage for every 1000 nodes, Hertz 1991).</p>

<p>As a Boltzmann machine is stochastic, my understanding is that it would not necessarily always show the same pattern when the energy difference between one stored pattern and another is similar. But because of this stochasticity, maybe it allows for denser pattern storage but without the guarantee that you'll always get the ""closest"" pattern in terms of energy difference. Would this be true? Or would a Hopfield net be able to store more patterns?</p>

488,488,,,"<p>The Control Problem is, in short, the idea that AI will eventually be much better decision-makers than humans. If we don't set things up correctly beforehand, we won't get a chance to fix it afterwards, because AI will have effective control.</p>

<p>There are three main areas of discussion with regards to the Control Problem:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Whether or not the problem is urgent. Many AI experts, cognizant of the difficulty of getting simple systems to work effectively today, think that AI able to take control is not urgent, and as detail-minded engineers, they think it will be profoundly difficult to do any useful work today. (Andrew Ng, for example, famously called these sorts of worries like worrying about overpopulation on Mars.) Given radical uncertainty among AI experts as to when this will become an issue, however, this means we can't rule out rapid AI timescales, and should do at least some work in anticipation of those timescales.</p></li>
<li><p>Whether or not the problem is hard. Many people give short, simple, and wrong solutions to the control problem. Probably the most famous is the idea that intelligence and morality are inherently interlinked, and thus a more intelligent machine, <em>by definition</em>, will be more moral. The Orthogonality Thesis is the claim of the opposite, that intelligence and morality (or, more specifically, goal alignment) are unrelated things.</p></li>
<li><p>What foundations we can lay now. There are a bunch of open problems (see, for example, <a href=""https://intelligence.org/technical-agenda/"">MIRI's technical agenda</a>) that deal with mathematical logic of the sort that would be useful for ensuring robust value alignment, or on how to effectively do value learning (without giving an incentive to distort values), or on how to build value functions and goals such that they are fixable if they turn out to be mistaken. Those look like problems that we can do useful work on now, even without knowing what the actual structure of a future AI will look like.</p></li>

489,489,,,"<p>I don't think there are many contexts where there is any really meaningful distinction between these terms.  Even in the WP article you refer to, it is shown that ""abstract intelligent agent"" and ""autonomous intelligent agent"" are generally just synonyms for ""intelligent agent"" but used to highlight certain aspects of intelligent agents in some contexts.   Net-net, I'd say there just isn't any difference there that's going to matter in practice.</p>

<p>""Virtual intelligent agent"" OTOH, used in the context you used it, suggests the distinction between an IA that's implemented in software only, versus one that has a physical manifestation.   I don't know how useful that distinction is and I haven't seen anybody else make it.  </p>

<p>All in all, I expect that in almost every possible context, if you just say ""Intelligent Agent"" with no qualifiers, that's going to be sufficient.   But if there were going to be an exception, I'd say it would be around the term ""autonomous"" since an agent which is truly autonomous, versus one that needs to operate in a specific, constrained environment, is a distinction that - at least in principle - could be useful. </p>

It's sort of a subtle distinction, but the point is that no, we don't understand the very deepest details of how exactly you go from a bunch of weights, to, say, recognizing a cat playing with a ball.  </p>

<p>At least in terms of image recognition, the best explanation I've heard is that successive layers of a neural network learn more sophisticated features, composed of the more granular features from earlier levels.  That is to say, the first layer might recognize ""edges"" or ""straight lines"".  The next layer might then learn geometric shapes like ""box"", or ""triangle"", and then a higher layer might learn ""nose"" or ""eye"" based on those earlier features, and then a higher level layer still learns ""face"" made up from ""eye"", ""nose"", ""jaw"", etc.   But even that, as I understand it, is still hypothetical and/or not understood in complete detail. </p>

It has rarely made its way into large commercial applications, having said that, a famous commercial implementation is in <a href=""http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/ALP/2011/03/natural-language-processing-with-prolog-in-the-ibm-watson-system/"" rel=""nofollow"">Watson, where prolog is used for NLP</a>.</p>

<p>There seems to be a common structure of a directed graph, with values in each node. Some nodes are input nodes. Their values can be set.

496,496,,,"<p>I will overly simplify ANNs in order to point how they work. Examples might not be 100% accurate.</p>

<p>In the simplest form, network is trained using the apriori information extracted from the ground truth. This basically means that ANN uses the relation between the input and output. </p>

<p>For instance, if you are to classify shrubs and trees, one of the input could be height and the other could be the width of the tree. Now, if you have only input and output layers, increasing height means increasing chance for the object to be a tree. Thus, input height would have a positive weight connecting to tree output and a negative weight to shrub output. However, as the plant gets wider, the chance of it being a shrub increases. Taller shrubs are wider than shorter ones. Thus input weight would have positive weight connecting to the shrub output. Finally, the chance of being a tree is not affected by the width and thus will have close to 0 weight between this input and output. This network will effectively work like a linear discriminant classifier.</p>

<p>Now instead of assigning weights by hand, you may use a learning algorithm that tries to adjust weights so that the output is correct when the series of input is supplied. Ideally this training algorithm should reach to the conclusion that we have made in the previous example. Most training algorithms are recursive. They supply the inputs multiple times, and in a simple sense, they reward pathways that are correct by increasing their weights and punishes pathways that are causing incorrect answer.</p>

<p>When hidden layers are used in a system, they would be able to correlate input on higher degrees. Thus, as the number of layers get higher, ANN learns the input set much better. However, this does not mean it gets better. If the ANN over fits the input set, it would be affected from the random noise that is in the dataset. This problem is generally referred as memorization. There are learning algorithms that try to minimize memorization and maximize generalization ability. But ultimately, the number of training samples should be high enough so that ANN cannot overfit to the data.</p>

<p>Regarding the motivation for crossover - from <a href=""https://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/book/metaheuristics/"" rel=""nofollow"">Essentials of Metaheuristics</a>, p42:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Crossover was originally based on the premise that highly fit individuals often share certain traits, called <em>building blocks</em>, in common.
  For example, in the boolean individual 10110101, perhaps
  ***101*1 might be a building block </p>
</blockquote>

<p>(where * means ""either 0 or 1"") </p>

<p>So the idea is that crossover works by spreading building blocks quickly throughout the population.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Crossover methods also assume that there is some degree of linkage between genes on the chromosome: that is, settings for certain genes in groups are strongly correlated to fitness improvement. For example, genes A and B might contribute to fitness only when they’re both set to 1: if either is set to 0, then the fact that the other is set to 1 doesn’t do anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also note that <em>crossover is not a global operator</em>. If the only operator is crossover then (also from p42):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eventually the population will converge, and often (unfortunately) prematurely

<p>Consider a hypothetical scenario where we are applying a genetic algorithm to find a solution that performs well at 2 tasks. This could be from Franck's example (moving and shooting) for an AI, or perhaps it could be predicted 2 outputs in a genetic machine learning scenario, but really most scenarios where GAs are applied are synonymous (even at solving a single task, there may be different aspects of the task to be addressed).</p>

<p>Suppose we had an individual, 1, that was performing reasonably well at both tasks, and we found a series of mutations which produced 2 new individuals, 2 and 3, which performed better than Individual 1 at tasks 1 and 2 respectively. Now while both of these are improvements, ideally we want to find a generally good solution, so we want to combine the features that we have been found to be beneficial. </p>

<p>This is where crossover comes in; by combining the genomes of Individuals 2 and 3, we may find some new individual which produces a mixture of their performances. While it is possible that such an individual could be produced by a series of mutations applied to Individual 2 or Individual 3, the landscape may simply not suit this (there may be no favorable mutations in that direction, for example).</p>

<p>You are partially right therefore; it may sometimes be the case that the benefits of crossover could be replicated with a series of mutations. Sometimes this may not be the case and crossover may smooth the fitness landscape of your GA, speeding up optimization and helping your GA escape local optima. </p>

<p>Training set: how about two sets of negative and positive examples, consisting of (features extracted from) bad code and from a refactored version (respectively)?</p>

<p>One elementary choice of features would be to apply a bunch of code complexity metrics and have the learning algorithm combine those. The plus side of working in such a numeric domain is that the learning algorithm might readily find a gradient to exploit. The downside is that the rules (which are then likely of the form <code>if mcabe &gt; 2.8</code> etc) are still not as informative as might be desired.</p>

<p>I choose a way that is easy for an human (me, in particular!) to make sense of:</p>

<pre><code>training_data = np.array([[0,0,0,

target_data = np.array([[0],[0],[1],[1]], ""float32"")
</code></pre>

<p>This basically just use an array of length 9 to represent a 3 x 3 board. The first three items represent the first row, the next three the second row and so on. The line breaks should make it obvious I guess.</p>

<p>The target data then maps the first two game states to ""no wins"" and the last two game states to ""wins"".</p>

<p>Then I wanted to create some validation data that is slightly different to see if it generalizes.</p>

<pre><code>validation_data = np.array([[0,0,0,
                             0,0,0,
                             0,0,0],

                             1,0,0],
                            [1,0,0,
                             0,1,0,
                             0,0,1],
                            [0,0,1,
                             0,0,1,
                             0,0,1]], ""float32"")
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, again the last two game states should be ""wins"" whereas the first two should not.</p>

<p>I tried to play with the number of neurons and learning rate but no matter what I try, my output looks pretty of. E.g.</p>

<pre><code>[[ 0.01207292]
 [ 0.98913926]
 [ 0.00925775]
 [ 0.00577191]]

<h3>Why we need the 'only self-driving cars'?</h3>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=36823"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Secretary-General said the UN</a> would work hard to prevent further deaths on the roads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many tragedies can be avoided through a set of proven, simple measures that benefit not only individuals and families but society at large.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are my points:</p>

<ul>
<li>To achieve 'a set of proven measures' - do not allow people to drive - simple.</li>
<li>People tend to break the rules, always, so do not allow them to drive without permission.</li>
<li>Reduce stealing cars and other crime.</li>
<li>Law enforcement dream is to able to stop any car on demand.</li>
<li>Do not allow drunk people to drive a car.</li>
<li>Disallow terrorist attacks, like in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Nice_attack"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nice where truck killed over 80 people</a>.</li>
<li>Avoid bank robberies and similar which are possible by escaping fast cars.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is it possible? I believe it depends on specific countries and unions and how quickly we're able to advance and be ready for such change.</p>

<p>To support such a claim, <a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~illah/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Illah Nourbakhsh</a>, a professor of robotics at Carnegie Mellon University, gave an interview to the New York Times magazine cover story on autonomous driving cars, and includes this hypothetical scenario, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If they’re outside walking, and the sun is at just the right glare level, and there’s a mirrored truck stopped next to you, and the sun bounces off that truck and hits the guy so that you can’t see his face anymore — well, now your car just sees a stop sign. <strong>The chances of all that happening are diminishingly small — it’s very, very unlikely</strong> — but the problem is we will have millions of these cars. The very unlikely will happen all the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even so, the risk would be minimal, since the car is always looking out for traffic, pedestrians and other obstacles.</p>

538,538,,,"<p>Tesla model S has <a href=""https://www.tesla.com/models"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Autopilot</a> which allows to steer within a lane, change lanes with the simple tap of a turn signal, and can manage speed by using traffic-aware cruise control. Multiple digital controls helps to avoid collisions. Based on that, this isn't fully self-driving car.</p>

<p>However it is using a computer vision detection system, but it is not intended to be used hands-free.</p>

<p>So basically what is known is that the accident involved the side of a truck trailer (of a large white 18-wheel truck) and most likely the camera had a washed out of picture possibly due to glare or blooming from overexposure which made that the side of the trailer white and thin which failed to distinguish with the sky which was bright as well.</p>

<p>This may have happened in part, because the crash-avoidance system only engage when both radar and vision system detect an obstacle which could not happen.</p>

<p>Further more it was suggested by <em>The Associated Press</em> that the driver most likely was watching a <em>Harry Potter</em> at the time of the crash and assuming system would alert Brown, we don't know if he was able to retake controls quickly enough to avoid impact. As mentioned again, the system wasn't intended for hands-free driving and parts of the system was unfinished. Not to mention that the car was driving with full speed under the trailer.</p>

<p>Tesla officially said about this crash in a statement on its website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The high ride height of the trailer combined with its positioning across the road and the extremely rare circumstances</strong> of the impact caused the Model S to pass under the trailer, with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the Model S.</p>
  
  <p>Neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They also said, according to techno-optimists, that they will tweaks their code, so this particular case won't happen again.</p>

<p>To summarize, this was a 'technical failure' of braking system and most likely Autopilot was not at as Tesla told Senate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Humans have been endowed with personalities by nature, and it is not clear (to me at least) if this is a feature or a bug. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my opinion, this is a statement that constrains the question, since it assumes that the personality is <em>given</em>. To me, it feels a bit like <em>playing god</em>: Artificial (given) Intelligence would hence imply Artificial (given) Personality. This approach to the problem seems to be supported by the next fragment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a notion of personality is useful</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I point to the above because I don't think that artificial intelligence... <strong><em>Intelligence</em></strong> itself, actually, need to be given or assigned, or even have a <em>use</em> in the sense of a <em>purpose</em>. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>The previous note</strong> was about <em>emergence</em>, which is a topic that <a href=""http://ai.stackexchange.com/users/42/user217281728"">user217281728</a> briefly addressed in <a href=""http://ai.stackexchange.com/a/1596/70"">their answer</a>. In this second approach, the particular traits <em>just happen</em>, or <em>develop</em>. The interaction between the (so-called) agents and their environment, as well as fellow agents can give place to new behaviour patterns, not designed beforehand. </p>

<p><strong>In an evolutionary</strong> approach, if the personality would happen to have an advantage (or at least not represent a disadvantage), then it could just appear. Of course, I am making a number of assumptions and demarcations here as well:</p>

<ul>
<li>I am thinking about embodied intelligence</li>
<li>I speak of evolutionary robotics</li>
<li>I think on social issues being of importance</li>
<li>I assume that <em>personality</em> could emerge</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Now, an example</strong> that I find extremely interesting is that of the little mobile robots which could move around and end-up in a pool of <em>food</em> or a pool of <em>poison</em>. And they, somehow, by some odd chance, recognised or made a relation between signals sent by other robots, and the presence of food. Or not. That was more or less the thing: Some robots (kind of) learned to <em>conceal</em> information and thus had more time to eat themselves. Well, I would have a couple of personality adjectives for such guys.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/106/37/15786.full"" rel=""nofollow"">Here you find the article</a> and <a href=""https://wp.unil.ch/mitrilab/"" rel=""nofollow"">here you find some videos</a> and related stuff.</p>

<p><strong>And with that</strong>, we land at my last point: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism#In_computing"" rel=""nofollow"">We humans</a> put the adjectives, according to our social conditioning. We call <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_(character)"" rel=""nofollow"">Marvin</a> <em>depressive</em> and <a href=""http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/why-do-we-love-r2-d2-and-not-c-3po-180951176/"" rel=""nofollow"">R2D2</a> lovely and charming. </p>

<p>If they perceive their personalities as constructive or damaging, will always depend on our own judgment. In the end, it is quite common under humans to disagree on personality issues, too.</p>

564,564,,,"<p>The rendering process for browsers is <a href=""https://www.w3.org/"">very well defined</a>, and has a very rigid definite ruleset where (virtually) every accountability is noted and handled. This is not optimal for Machine Learning, which works when we have a large pool of examples, and we don't know the ruleset; it will figure it out. Even if you were to train an Neural Network to process that input, there are several things you must account for:</p>

<p><strong>1. Variance in data.</strong></p>

<p>Not all webpages are equal in length or complexity, and making a neural network to generate output from HTML would produce garbage most of the time.</p>

<p><strong>2. Training time.</strong></p>

<p>The time it would take for a neural network to understand HTML tags, attributes, the DOM Tree, and each and every element, including new ones being added every few years, and how each one renders and behaves, would take an extremely long time, most likely several years on a fast computer, if it even were possible</p>

<p><strong>3. Interactivity.</strong></p>

<p>Web pages aren't just static, they change according HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Not only would you have to design your system to account for the rendering step, you would also make it have to understand the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness"">Turing Complete</a> scripting language <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript"">JavaScript</a>, as well as the less complicated, but inherently intertwined with HTML, CSS stylesheet language. If you thought the rendering process was easy, try training a neural network to handle complicated scripting patterns.</p>

<p><strong>4. New Standards</strong></p>

<p>Not all HTML is equal, because of different standards. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Hypertext_Application_Technology_Working_Group"">WHATWG</a> began working on HTML5 in 2004, and browsers started to implement not long after. In 2004, there were very few examples of HTML5 sites to train your network to begin with. Sure, now it's standardized and every website uses it, but what about HTML6? When the first specification is released (probably 2017-2025), virtually no websites will use it, because no one will support it. Only when it finally becomes standard, probably in the late 2020s or early 2030s, will you have enough data to train your monstrous system of neural networks</p>

<hr />

<p>As for AI in general, one could argue that browsers already use A.I. in their rendering process. They intelligently decide what to render (taking CSS into account), when in order to get the most efficient render time, they selectively use different JavaScript parsers on different sections of the code to optimize the speed, the whole system has been optimized on another ruleset to make rendering and interacting with a webpage as seamless and easy-to-use as possible. Your system will never be as good as what hundreds of humans have optimized over 20 years.</p>

<p>Trying to solve HTML rendering with Neural Networks is akin to trying to nail a nail with a screwdriver. It's just not going to work</p>

The 'SPARK"" and agents first look at what is on the detectors and SPARK select the best agent. And the SPARK turn on and off agents like in a orchestra. As the system matures many agents will work in parallel.
This process is the the subconscious mind.
After a while one of the agent is converted to a copy of of SPARK. This new copy is then modified and is called the OFF SPARK. The conscious mind. It will take on the control of the agents too. But SPARK is still master of all.
OFF SPARK can activate agents. But it can organizes agents on a massive scale.
It will develop many routines. Many agents working in parallel.
Once theses massive agent swarm developed into perfected routine will become a reflex. And all reflexes will be given over to SPARK the subconscious part of this system. Stored for latter use.
If OFF SPARK needs to get over to a new areas to create new patterns, like working the slot machine for the first time, to develop new routines. it need automated subconscious process of walking over the that area. OFF SPARK starts the walking routine and hands off over to spark.
IF the craving for food becomes too strong then SPARK shuts down OFF SPARK. And then uses OFF SPARK routines to get food or what urgent goal that need to be taken care of.
If all urgent goals are taken care of then there will be free will because OFF SPARK will be in control. And SPARK will be push into helper mode.
The AGI has a internal pattern editor, that is only used by OFF SPARK. that cut up existing physical routines and tries to rebuild new and different routines. This is a trial and error generator. Once a editing procedure work and perfected it is handed over to Spark for storage. Off SPAK initiate a editing routines and then SPark take over.
This editing of patterns will lead to a internal 3D simulator.

Human emotions are closely related to conscious experience characterized by intense mental activity, which is based on interpretation of events.</p>

<p>Recent brain studies (including research in cognitive psychology and neurophysiology) suggests that human emotional assessment of every action or event plays an important role in human mental processes.</p>

<p>The recent <a href=""http://bica2016.bicasociety.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">2016 Annual Meeting of the BICA Society</a> brought together scientists from around the world to approach principles and mechanisms of human thought to create biologically inspired AI.</p>

<p>For example, in Samsonovich's (a professor in the Cybernetics Department at the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Research_Nuclear_University_MEPhI"" rel=""nofollow"">MEPhI</a>) proposal, the idea is to test AI in computer games which involves actions with emotional content, where AI may engage with players in different types of social relationships (such as trust, subordination or leadership).</p>

<p>Jonathan Gratch of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Creative_Technologies"" rel=""nofollow"">ICT</a>, invented virtual characters capable of identifying and expressing emotions by communicating with humans in their natural language based on the situations where for example AI can deceive a human to achieve the desired result. The effect is obviously not achieved by re-creating human consciousness, but by achieving statistically adjusting parameters.</p>

<p>Researchers from the Institute of Cyber Intelligence Systems in MEPhI are hoping to be able to create in the near future future virtual beings which are capable of planning, setting goals and establishing social relationships with humans, also by possessing both emotional and narrative intelligence which can interpret context of events.</p>

579,579,,,"<p>Humans have poor understanding of emotional rules. Probably every poster on here has experienced <em>greatly</em> misreading another individual emotionally. Further, people often don't act emotionally how they would expect themselves to act, for example we have all experienced frustration at someone else's irrational concerns and yet we are all guilty of holding irrational concerns of our own. This is the crux of why hard-coded emotional rules do not work - we do not have an understanding of what emotional 'rules' make someone feel real.</p>

<p>By moving towards autonomous state-based actors we move away from this issue. The actor's state transitions will of course be defined rules (hard-coded or learnt) but by abstracting the actor's emotional state from the specific context (e.g. specific actions trigger emotional state transitions which trigger responses, instead of a direct response to a specific action), the programmer prevents them-self from projecting their own beliefs/emotions/logic onto the actor. </p>

<p>Further, autonomous actors are more extendable. Consider an autonomous actor that is hard-coded to move towards 'upset' and 'angry' emotional states when experiencing 'pain'. Simply by associating a new world action with 'pain', one can trigger an emotional response from an autonomous actor that has not experienced that action before. When working in hard-coded emotional rules, this would not be possible.</p>

In the limit, testing for intelligence requires intelligence and creativity on behalf of the questioner.</p>

<p>'No': It may be that, even with infinite ability to simulate, there may be some missing aspect of our simulation that is necessary for intelligence.

What if that was needed, but we didn't know how to include it in the simulation?</p>

<p>The reason for talking in terms of such incredibly costly computations as 'simulate all possible universes' (or at least a brain-sized portion of them) is to deliberately generalize away from the specifics of any techniques currently in vogue (DL, neuromorphic systems etc).

<p>Humans have quite good mechanisms (both behavioral and social) for interacting in a complex world (mostly) without harming one another, but these are perhaps not so easily codified. The complex set of legal rules that sit on top of this (polution regulations etc) are the ones that we could most easily program, but they are really quite specialised relative to the underlying physiological and social 'rules'.</p>

<p>EDIT: From other comments, it seems worth distinguishing between 'all possible harm' and 'all the kinds of harm that humans routinely anticipate'. There seems to be consensus that 'all possible harm' is a non-starter, which still leaves the hard (IMO, AI-complete) task of equaling human ability to predict harm. </p>

<p>Even if we can do that, if we are to treat as actual laws, then we would still need a formal mechanism for conflict resolution (e.g. ""Robot, I will commit suicide unless you punch that man""). </p>

The obvious benefit of this is scalability; in order to make translators for a new language to any other language, you just need to learn that language and the models build themselves.)</p>

593,593,,,"<p>We're definitely nowhere near that level of AI; at best, high-tech solutions like deep convolutional neural nets can help with image recognition and some other algorithms can perform things like robotic movement adequately enough to be useful in some scenarios. None of this is even as sophisticated as the behavior of a flea, but no one refers to insects as ""intelligent."" It's exciting stuff that allows us to solve problems that human intelligence often has difficulty with (such as classification of thousands of objects, which would tire an ordinary human mind), but it's nowhere close to replicating our higher brain functions. </p>

<p>Also keep in mind that the Turing test is a poor test of ""intelligence"" that defies common sense. By the same extension, mistaking a mannequin for a human being in the dark does not mean that the mannequin is actually human. If it were a valid test, then we passed that way back around 1980 with programs like Dear Eliza which were coded in BASIC to regurgitate human speech patterns. There's just no need to come up with a sophisticated argument like Searle's Chinese Room to debunk it, since it's silly on its face; any layman should be able to see right through the Turing Test. If anyone except Turing had come up with this test it would not have received much attention. Turing displayed one-of-a-kind genius when it came to things like computing and cryptography, but like many other experts in such fields, he had a lot of trouble grappling with metaphysics and philosophy. Searle had more common sense, but his Chinese Room example is more of a rebuttal to the Turing Test than a test in and of itself.</p>

<p>What ""intelligence"" consists of is ultimately a deep metaphysical question, not a material one. For millennia, trained philosophers have had a lot of trouble assigning clear definitions to concepts like intelligence and consciousness. Until we can answer those questions definitively, using different sets of reasoning skills than scientists, mathematicians and computer specialists are used to employing (just look at how often metaphysics is derided in some of these disciplines) then we cannot say that we have achieved genuine A.I. Until we can define what intelligence is, we cannot say whether or not we've successfully built it; we've not only got the cart before the horse, but have yet to build the cart or see a horse. By the common definitions used in everyday speech we're nowhere near genuine A.I. No one calls cows or sparrows ""intelligent,"" but our AI today isn't even as sophisticated as the mosquitoes that bite them. </p>

<p>That's not going to be a popular answer - I'll probably get a dozen downvotes for this, without anyone being able to adequately rebut my contentions, but it needs to be said. There's far too much irrational exuberance and gross overestimation of what we've achieved to date and probably always will be in this field. Historically, researchers in every generation have also grossly underestimated the computing power of the human brain; every decade or so, the estimates of the FLOPS and megabytes have to be drastically revised. We have a poor track record of even getting basic material questions about the human brain right. This clear, consistent pattern of biased overestimation of our success and the lack of any real definition, let alone a test, of intelligence is going to be a serious issue in this forum for its whole existence (assuming it survives the private beta period). We have a whole forum dedicated to a field we can't even define; we can't say for sure what A.I. really is, but we're adamantly certain that we're close to achieving it...!  We cannot say if ""brute force algorithms"" exist when we're still groping for an understanding of what it is we're trying to force our way into. Certainly, there are brute force methods to solve certain problems, like Deep Blue does at chess - but we cannot say if that qualifies as intelligence or not. It is really not possible to answer questions like this without getting into deep discussions that immediately lend themselves to opinion and debate, which the Turing Test and Searle's Room are clear examples of, in and of themselves. Since implementation details of AI are considered by many to be off-limits here, we're limited mainly to highly speculative posts about tech that often doesn't even work yet (like Google's self-driving cars) and questions like this that we can't answer without first defining intelligence. This is going to be the root of a lot of problems here for a long, long time to come...</p>

598,598,,,"<p>Typically, I think of intelligence in terms of the <em>control</em> of <em>perception</em>. [1] A related, but different, definition of intelligence is the (at least partial) restriction of possible future states. For example, an intelligent Chess player is one whose future rarely includes 'lost at chess to a weaker opponent' states; they're able to make changes that move those states to 'won at chess' states.</p>

<p>These are both broad and continuous definitions of intelligence, where we can talk about differences of degree. A sundial doesn't exert any control over its environment; it passively casts a shadow, and so doesn't have intelligence worth speaking of. A thermostat attached to a heating or cooling system, on the other hand, does exert control over its environment, trying to keep the temperature of its sensor within some preferred range. So a thermostat does have intelligence, but not very much.</p>

<p>Self-driving cars obviously fit those definitions of intelligence.</p>

<hr>

<p>[1] Control is meant in the context of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">control theory</a>, a branch of engineering that deals with dynamical systems that perceive some fact about the external world and also have a way by which they change that fact. When perception is explicitly contrasted to observations, it typically refers to an abstract feature of observations (you observe the intensity of light from individual pixels, you perceive the apple that they represent) but here I mean it as a superset that includes observation. The thermostat is a dynamical system that perceives temperature and acts to exert pressure on the temperature it perceives.</p>

<p>(There's a philosophical point here that the thermostat cares directly about its sensor reading, not whatever the temperature ""actually"" is. I think that's not something that should be included in intelligence, and should deserve a name of its own, because understanding the difference between perception and reality and seeking to make sure one's perceptions are accurate to reality is another thing that seems partially independent of intelligence.)</p>

<p>What I've found AI, and 'intelligent' systems moreso represent is an aid or a support that works <em>for</em> us, rather than one that works <em>because</em> of us... hear me out:</p>

<p>What makes the jump to an intelligent system for me is the step where the system begins to 'adapt / learn' or otherwise do things I didn't directly tell it to do. With the sundial, I measured and cut every inch of it by hand, and put it in a specific way to do a specific thing. </p>

<p>When a programmer gets into a car he automated, it may do some things he didn't directly program or maybe couldn't even expect (just one example: querying some database to see lots of people are driving somewhere, discovering a concert is going on there, and asking if the driver wants directions / tickets)</p>

<p>In conclusion, an intelligent system to me is one that we build in such a way that it educates and supports <em>us</em>, rather than a system we ourselves 'educate' to do a specific task.

<p>For law 1, any AI would abide by the first rule unless it was deliberately created to be malevolent, in that the AI it would understand harm was imminent but do nothing about or would actively attempt to harm. Any 'reasonable' AI would (try its best to) prevent any harm it understood, but couldn't react to imminent harm 'outside it's knowledge', thus satisfying law 1. Any AI that 'tries its best' to prevent harm works here.</p>

<p>For law 2, it is simply a matter of design. If one can design an AI capable of parsing and understanding the entirety of human language (beyond just speech), just program it to act accordingly, mindful of the first law. Thus, I think we can develop an AI that will obey every command <em>it understands</em> but getting it to understand anything and everything I believe is impossible.</p>

<p>For law 3, it rides in the same vein as law 1.</p>

In that scenario, learning from an additional 10G of text would use less storage than the original.</p>

<p>OTOH, as others have said, it could be that the storage is mostly storing the <em>links</em> between things, in which case the number of links will likely grow exponentially. In that case, the second batch of ""knowledge"" would add more storage requirements than the first.</p>

616,616,,,"<p>I'll try to do something intuitive; Each node in a neural network is referred to as a neuron. To understand what's going on under the hood of a neural network you only really need to understand an individual neuron. </p>

<p>Now each neuron has a set of inputs (other neurons; they can potentially be the inputs to the network as a whole as well), and each input has a weight associated with it. Every time the network is used, each neuron computes its output as the weighted sum of its inputs passed through some gate (The ""Activation Function"", a mathematical function designed to get a particular behaviour. For example sigmoid AF takes an input of any size and transforms it into an output in the range [0, 1].) Obviously, this is driven from the inputs to the neural network so that no neuron is computing its outputs before all of the neurons used as its inputs have done the same.</p>

<p>When you refer to the value of a node; there isn't a single value. Each neuron has several weights associated with it as it may be the input to several other neurons, and each of those neurons assigns it a different weight. Instead, it is better to thing of a neural network as a directed graph of nodes (neurons) which are labelled with a particular activation function, and edges (input/output connections) which are labelled with a particular weight. While the structure and activation functions used in the neural networks is a matter of topology design, there are a number of algorithms for designing a ANN for a particular topology.</p>

<p>The most commonly used (and possibly easiest to explain) is backpropagation. In pseudo-Layman's terms we start off with random weights on all edges in the network. We then compute the output of the network for a training set (a set of known input/output pairs). By careful choice of activation function, it is possible to differentiate the error (computed analogously to the expected output minus the actual output of the ANN for each input/output pair) with respect to the weights of the neural network. This allows us to compute a gradient for each weight; the direction in which we can move the weight to reduce the error on the training set. By doing this until we find an optima (a point where all movements increase error), we can find some 'good' configuration of weights for that particular ANN. </p>

That said, I should prefix this by saying there isn't just one way to ""get there from here.""  Many techniques could be part of a stack for accomplishing this goal.</p>

<p>Anyway, in the case of Stanbol, they run the text through multiple processing engines, sequentially, with different engines affecting the final output.  One engine simply does <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition"" rel=""nofollow"">Named Entity Recognition</a> using OpenNLP.  This identities discrete named ""things"" - people, places, companies, etc.  Another engine does entity matching with a pre-established database of entities - specifically (in the out-of-the-box configuration) a dump of entities from <a href=""http://www.dbpedia.org"" rel=""nofollow"">DBPedia</a>.  Where a match is found, the text from the original input is assigned to the entity.  In the case of a collision, it assigns a weight to the mapping so any downstream consumers can use probabilistic techniques to select the ""correct"" mapping.</p>

<p>There are, of course, more details that I left out.  Before NER can happen there is parsing and tokenizing and other NLP activities.  But a big part of the basic process is doing NER and then doing the entity matching.  </p>

<p>And in the case of Stanbol, you can add your own entities and corresponding structured data, as well as your own engines.  So, for example, if you wanted to write an engine based on neural networks / deep learning, and plug that in, you could.</p>

The AI system in your car will get you safely home, but won’t choose another destination once you’ve gone inside. From there, we’ll add basic drives, along with emotions and moral values. If we create machines that learn as well as our brains do, it’s easy to imagine them inheriting human-like qualities—and flaws. </p>

<p>Personally, I have generally taken the position that talking about emotions for artificial intelligences is silly, because there would be no <em>reason</em> to create AI's that experience emotions.  Obviously Yann disagrees.  So the question is:  what end would be served by doing this?  Does an AI <em>need</em> emotions to serve as a useful tool?  </p>

<p>They, however, makes no mention of what specific methods they use.</p>

<p>So a crime detection system as that is written does not exist, but abnormal behaviour detection systems do.</p>

<p>An accurate generalized system seems intuitively infeasible, however. Commiting a crime, unlike falling, is a complex behavior, and takes so many forms. A camera watching a store's counter like at a 7-11 could perhaps see that the 'customer''s arm is strangely reaching across the counter, and the attendant is moving a lot more than usual suddenly, but aside from very specific cases like this such a system is currently quite unfeasible. </p>

<p>Crimes are unusual, relatively speaking, and their dramatic nature means that even the simplest crimes play out in very different ways. Perhaps you could in this case you could try to look for images of a gun, or someone with their hands up. So, looking for unusual, <em>detectable</em> behavioural mannerisms may be possible, but not crime detection.</p>

<p>Ultimately, while you may be able to make (possibly pretty good) systems to detect specific crimes in specific environments, that's all we got for now.</p>

<p>The first thing the system should do is check and associate each symptom (in this case represented by alphabetical letters) individually against a data-table of symptoms that already exist. And in cases where the input doesn't exist, the system should report or send feedback about it.</p>

<p>And also, let's say that <code>A and B</code> was in the data-table, so we are 100% sure that they're valid or exist and the system is able to give out the disease based on the input. Then let's say that the input now is <code>C and D</code> where <code>C</code> doesn't exist in the data-table, but there is a possibility that <code>D</code> exists.</p>

<p>We don't give <code>D</code> a score of 100%, but maybe something lower (let's say 90%). Then <code>C</code> just doesn't exist at all in the data-table. So, <code>C</code> gets a score of 0%.</p>

<p>The fourth page explains why SRL is interesting. ""Traditional statistical machine learning approaches"" process one sort of thing in which there is some uncertaintly. Image identification is a good example of that. ""Traditional <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_logic_programming"">ILP</a>/relational learning approaches"" use several kinds of information to produce hypotheses about the data set, but apparently allow for no noise in the data.</p>

<p>Statistical relational learning models are intended to work with data sets that have several types of objects connected to each other via various links (hence ""relational""). They also are meant to deal with uncertainty (hence ""statistical"").</p>

<p>Skipping past some slides that aren't really useful without a transcript of what was said over them, we come to slide 17, which has comprehensible definitions and examples:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Object classification</strong>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Predicting the category of an object based on its attributes <em>and</em> its links <em>and</em> attributes of linked objects</li>
  <li>e.g., predicting the topic of a paper based on the words used in the paper the topics of papers it cites the used in the paper, the topics of papers it cites, the research interests of the author</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><strong>Object type prediction</strong>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Predicting the type of an object based on its attributes and its links and attributes of linked objects</li>
  <li>e.g., predict the venue type of a publication (conference, journal, workshop) based on properties of the paper</li>
  </ul></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see, these models can keep track of several things and the interactions between them. The next slide talks about link prediction, the ability to predict several attributes of connections between objects, like the importance/quality of a citation. As previously mentioned, these models don't require 100% accurate data to give interesting results; academic citation lists might occasionally be less than comprehensive, and the importance of a citation is challenging to quantify.</p>

<p>Like ILP, SLP will hopefully be able to ""see"" new kinds of links between ""entities"", as with the presentation's example of identifying research communities.</p>

658,658,,,"<p>I think the fundamental question is: Why even attempt to build an AI? If that objective is clear, it will provide clarity to whether or not having emotional quotient in AI make sense. Some attempts like ""Paro"" that were developed for therapeutic reasons requires they exhibit some human like emotions. Again, note that ""displaying"" emotions and ""feeling"" emotions are two completely different things. </p>

<p>You can program a thing like paro to modulate the voice tones or facial twitches to express sympathy, affection, companionship, or whatever - but while doing so, a paro does NOT empathize with its owner - it is simply faking it by performing the physical manifestations of an emotion. It never ""feels"" anything remotely closer to what that emotion evokes in human brain. </p>

<p>So this distinction is really important. For you to feel something, there needs to be an independent autonomous subject that has the capacity to feel. Feeling cannot be imposed by an external human agent. </p>

<p>So going back to the question of what purpose it solves - answer really is - It depends. And the most I think we will achieve ever with silicone based AIs will remain the domain of just physical representations of emotions. </p>

  <p>Weizenbaum tells us that he was shocked by the experience of releasing ELIZA (also known as ""Doctor"") to the nontechnical staff at the MIT AI Lab. Secretaries and nontechnical administrative staff thought the machine was a ""real"" therapist, and spent hours revealing their personal problems to the program. When Weizenbaum informed his secretary that he, of course, had access to the logs of all the conversations, she reacted with outrage at this invasion of her privacy. Weizenbaum was shocked by this and similar incidents to find that such a simple program could so easily deceive a naive user into revealing personal information.</p>

<p>Wikipedia's article on the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">""ELIZA Effect""</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though designed strictly as a mechanism to support ""natural language conversation"" with a computer, ELIZA's DOCTOR script was found to be surprisingly successful in eliciting emotional responses from users who, in the course of interacting with the program, began to ascribe understanding and motivation to the program's output. As Weizenbaum later wrote, <strong>""I had not realized ... that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people.""</strong> Indeed, ELIZA's code had not been designed to evoke this reaction in the first place. Upon observation, researchers discovered users unconsciously assuming ELIZA's questions implied interest and emotional involvement in the topics discussed, <em>even when they consciously knew that ELIZA did not simulate emotion.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>ELIZA, despite its simplicity, was incredibly successful at its task of tricking other human beings. Even those who knew ELIZA was a bot would still talk to it. Obviously, ELIZA served as an inspiration for various other, more intelligent chatbots, such as <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/science/for-sympathetic-ear-more-chinese-turn-to-smartphone-program.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">Xiaoice</a>. But I would like to know what <em>exactly</em> led to such a simple program like ELIZA to be so successful in the first place.</p>

<p>It is not just our capacity to learn that evolved.

(I've worked on the fringes of AI for 25 years and have followed the tech for even longer.  These are exciting times.)</p>

<p>Initially, your very own AI companion (""Her""?) won't be capable of deeper philosophical conversation or insightful interpretation of novels or the human condition.  But it will be able to write / speak in full paragraphs on topics like the best choice among 5 possible routes between point A and B, or summarizing the plot of a book or the gist of a news story, or why one product is better than another (e.g. based on assessing hundreds of Amazon reviews).  And yes, it will be able to understand full spoken sentences from you, and generate both queries and answers.</p>

<p>I'm convinced such a bot <em>will</em> be useful enough that most of us will want one.  Of course you won't need to buy a special piece of hardware, like the Amazon Echo.  It'll be available via software on your smartphone, though the computing is likely to reside on the cloud (since that's where the data is).  </p>

<p>Frankly, I think this is where the next innovations in smartphones will arise -- verbal interfaces that do a better job hearing and speaking and disambiguating using context about you and the kinds of questions you are likely to ask.</p>

666,666,,,"<p>I think emotions are not necessary for an AI agent to be useful.  But I also think they could make the agent MUCH more pleasant to work with.  If the bot you're talking with can read your emotions and respond constructively, the experience of interacting with it will be tremendously more pleasant, perhaps spectacularly so.</p>

<p>Imagine contacting a human call center representative today with a complaint about your bill or a product.  You anticipate conflict.  You may have even decided NOT to call because you know this experience is going to be painful, either combative or frustrating, as someone misunderstands what you say or responds hostilely or stupidly.</p>

<p>Now imagine calling the kindest smartest most focused customer support person you've ever met -- Commander Data -- whose only reason for existing is to make this phone call as pleasant and productive for you as possible.  A big improvement over most call reps, yes?  Imagine then if call rep Data could also anticipate your mood and respond appropriately to your complaints to defuse your emotional state... you'd want to marry this guy.  You'd call up call rep Data any time you were feeling blue or bored or you wanted to share some happy news.  This guy would become your best friend overnight -- literally love at first call.</p>

<p>I'm convinced this scenario is valid. I've noticed in myself a surprising amount of attraction for characters like Data or Sonny from ""I Robot"".  The voice is very soothing and puts me instantly at ease.  If the bot were also very smart, patient, knowledgable, and understanding...  I really think such a bot, embued with a healthy dose of emotional intelligence, could be enormously pleasant to interact with.  Much more rewarding than any person I know.  And I think that's true of not just me.</p>

<p>What you need is something like a Sentiment2Vec (S2V) that captures the similarities between emotional transitions. Something like: subtract 'fear' from 'sadness', add 'joy' and you get 'hope'. Or: subtract 'sting' from 'papercut', add 'smashed' and you get 'throbbing'.</p>

<p>The catch is that you don't have an easily accessible corpus of emotional contexts to train with, like you have with words. If you had a million hours of fMRI - mapping the transitions between emotions in hundreds of subjects - then you could use that data to build an S2V. You probably don't have that data though.</p>

<p>In the mean time, you could just build a W2V that specializes in sentiment. You could even try to use a current sentiment analysis engine to bootstrap it. Perhaps if you read enough text that says ""I got a papercut and it stings"" and ""I smashed my finger and it's throbbing"" then you could eventually produce an S2V. Children's books often use explicit language regarding emotional context (""this made the boy feel sad"").</p>

<p>But words are still a far cry from the experiential context that a connectome map would provide. To test whether you have something useful or not, you might want to implement your S2V in a mouse foraging simulation - see whether it produces typical behavior and if any cooperative or competitive dynamics can organically grow out of your S2V.</p>

<p>To clarify terms, I interpret ""Strong AGI"" as ""potentially super intelligence, but at least human level.""</p>

<p>When we say ""Strong AGI"" vs just ""AGI,"" we're not saying that one is <em>more</em> open ended than the other. We are saying that the stronger one is simply smarter on some axis.</p>

<p>So to ask whether a particular trait would be ""more useful"" to a Strong AGI - that would depend on the purpose of the AGI. But here's the catch: if a thing had just one purpose, then the most efficient solution to fulfilling that one purpose will always be a narrow solution, not a general one. When the purpose of the object is known before hand, giving that object more general capability than is necessary for that purpose is counterproductive.</p>

<p>That's why it's impossible to make declarative prescriptions about what a free, open-ended AGI should or shouldn't need. Such prescriptions would nullify the open-ended freedom of utility that its generality implies. We <em>can</em> speak declaratively about lesser robots and animals.</p>

<p>But for any given problem, the solution we will want to find is the most well-defined, narrow, efficient one available - not the most general one.</p>

<p>In other words, sure, personalities could be useful for a Strong AGI, assuming the problems in question involved personalities.</p>

  <p>Deep Learning in general can be framed as optimization problem where the objective is a function of the model error. This optimization problem is very difficult to solve consider that the parameter space of the model (i.e. weights of the neural network) leads to a problem in extremely high dimension. An optimization algorithm could take a very long time to explore this space. Furthermore, there was an unverified belief that the problem was non-convex and computation would forever be stuck in local minima.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don't think anybody knows how to answer this for the general case. If they did, they'd have basically solved AGI.  But we can certainly talk about techniques that get part-of-the-way there, and approaches that could work.</p>

<p>One thing I would consider trying (and I don't know off-hand if anybody has tried this exact approach) is to model the disambiguation of each word as a discrete problem for a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network"" rel=""nofollow"">Bayesian Belief Network</a> where your priors (for any given word) are based on both stored ""knowledge"" as well as the previously encountered words in the (sentence|paragraph|document|whatever).  So if you ""know"", for example, that ""Reading is a city in the UK"" and that ""place names are usually capitalized"", your network should be strongly biased towards interpreting ""Reading"" as the city, since nothing in the word position in the sentence strongly contradicts that.  </p>

<p>Of course I'm hand-waving around some tricky problems in saying that, as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning"" rel=""nofollow"">knowledge representation</a> isn't exactly a solved problem either.  But there are at least approaches out there that you could use.

Finding a good way to merge that stuff with a Bayesian framework could yield some interesting results.    </p>

<p>There has been a bit of research on ""probabilistic RDF"" that you could possibly use as a starting point.  For example:</p>

692,692,,,"<p><strong>TL:DR</strong>: Hyper-heuristics <em>are</em> metaheuristics, suited for solving the same kind of optimization problems, but (in principle) affording a ""rapid prototyping"" approach for non-expert practitioners. In practice, there are issues with the prevailing approach, motivating an emerging perspective on <a href=""http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszeo/docs/publications/HHrecharacterization.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">'whitebox' hyper-heuristics</a>.</p>

<p>In more detail:</p>

<p>Metaheuristics are methods for searching an intractably large space of possible solutions in order to find a 'high quality' solution. Popular metaheuristics include Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, Genetic Algorithms etc.</p>

<p>The essential difference between metaheuristics and hyper-heuristics is the addition of a level of search indirection: informally, hyper-heuristics can be described as 'heuristics for searching the space of heuristics'. One can therefore use any metaheuristic as a hyper-heuristic, providing the nature of the 'space of heuristics' to be searched is appropriately defined.</p>

<p>The application area for hyper-heuristics is therefore the same as metaheuristics. Their applicability (relative to metaheuristics) is as a 'rapid prototyping tool': the original motivation was to allow non-expert practitioners to apply metaheuristics to their specific optimization problem (e.g. ""Travelling-Salesman (TSP) plus time-windows plus bin-packing"") without requiring expertise in the highly-specific problem domain. The idea was that this could be done by:</p>

<ol>
<li>Allowing practitioners to implement only very simple (effectively,
randomized) heuristics for transforming potential solutions. For
example, for the TSP: ""swap two random cities"" rather than (say) the more
complex <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin%E2%80%93Kernighan_heuristic"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lin-Kernighan</a> heuristic. </li>
<li>Achieve effective results (despite using these simple heuristics) by combining/sequencing them in an intelligent way, typically by employing some form of learning mechanism.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hyper-heuristics can be described as 'selective' or 'generative' depending on whether the heuristics are  (respectively) sequenced or combined. Generative hyper-heuristics thus often use methods such as Genetic Programming to combine primitive heuristics and are therefore typically customized by the practitioner to solve a specific problem. For example, the <a href=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/44119367/Hyper-heuristics_Learning_To_Combine_Sim20160326-8451-ouh5fe.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1472329757&amp;Signature=KT1E2ATKreC%2BGlTvPmJGYBFRSRY%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DHyper-heuristics_learning_to_combine_sim.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">original paper</a> on generative hyper-heuristics used a Learning Classifier System to combine heuristics for bin-packing. Because generative approaches are problem-specific, the comments below do not apply to them.</p>

<p>In contrast, the <a href=""http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgxk/papers/evocop02exs.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">original motivator</a> for selective hyper-heuristics was that researchers would be able to create a hyper-heuristic solver that was then likely to work well in an unseen problem domain, using only simple randomized heuristics.</p>

<p>The way that this has traditionally been implemented was via the introduction of the <a href=""http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~goc/papers/ChapterClassHH.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">'hyper-heuristic domain barrier'</a> (see figure, below), whereby generality across problem domains is claimed to be achievable by preventing the solver from having knowledge of the domain on which it is operating. Instead, it would solve the problem by operating only on opaque integer indices into a list of available heuristics (e.g. in the manner of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">'Multi-armed Bandit Problem'</a>).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6IFna.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6IFna.png"" alt=""Traditional notion of Selective Hyper-heuristic""></a></p>

<p>In practice, this 'domain blind' approach has not resulted in solutions of sufficient quality. In order to achieve results anywhere comparable to problem-specific metaheuristics, hyper-heuristic researchers have had to implement complex problem-specific heuristics, thereby failing in the goal of rapid prototyping.</p>

<p>It is still possible <em>in principle</em> to create a selective hyper-heuristic solver which is capable of generalizing to new problem domains, but this has been made more difficult since the above notion of domain barrier means that only a very limited feature set is available for cross-domain learning (e.g. as exemplified by a popular <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.5462"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">selective hyper-heuristic framework</a>).</p>

<p>A more recent research perspective towards <a href=""http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszeo/docs/publications/HHrecharacterization.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">'whitebox' hyper-heuristics</a> advocates a declarative, feature-rich approach to describing problem domains. This approach has a number of claimed advantages:</p>

<ol>
<li>Practitioners now need no longer <em>implement</em> heuristics, but rather simply <em>specify</em> the problem domain.</li>
<li>It eliminates the domain-barrier, putting hyper-heuristics on the same 'informed' status about the problem as problem-specific metaheuristics.</li>
<li>With a whitebox problem description, the infamous <a href=""https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/profile/dhw/papers/78.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">'No Free Lunch' theorem</a> (which essentially states that, considered over the space of all <em>black box</em> problems, Simulated Annealing with an infinite annealing schedule is, on average, as good as any other approach) no longer applies.</li>

703,703,,,"<p>This popular meme originated in the era of 'Good Old Fashioned AI' (GOFAI), when the belief was that intelligence could usefully be defined entirely in terms of logic.</p>

<p>The meme seems to rely on the AI parsing commands using a theorem prover, the idea presumably being that it's driven into some kind of infinite loop by trying to prove an unprovable or inconsistent statement.</p>

<p>Nowadays, GOFAI methods have been replaced by 'environment and percept sequences', which are not generally characterized in such an inflexible fashion. It would not take a great deal of sophisticated metacognition for a robot to observe that, after a while, its deliberations were getting in the way of useful work.</p>

<p>Rodney Brooks touched on this when speaking about the behavior of the robot in Spielberg's AI film, (which waited patiently for 5,000 years), saying something like ""My robots wouldn't do that - they'd get bored"". </p>

<p>Games like Portal, System Shock (with the AI 'Shodan'), and others give interpretations of what AI systems could be capable of themselves. Mass Effect is more or less entirely based around existential concepts regarding extra-terrestrial, almost primordial AI beings that threaten the earth.</p>

<p>But there's even more to it than the whole 'evil robots taking over the world' aspect. There's the actual <em>implementation</em> of AI in video games, which is where much of this technology first makes contact with the general public.</p>

<p>Ultimately, we only get things like the iPhone or VR headsets or other major proof-of-concept material only so often, but games are much more frequently implementing the most recent AI advances. </p>

<p>Thus, even though many AI systems are being put into place in the general workforce (many Hospitals now turning to cloud and AI health services, as recent as this week), I don't think you can really go further than video games or movies for 'simulations' or extrapolations like the ones you seem to want. </p>

705,705,,,"<p>Well, the issue of anthropomorphizing the AI aside, the answer is ""yes, sort of.""  Depending on how the AI is implemented, it's reasonable to say it could get ""stuck"" trying to resolve a paradox, or decide an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">undecidable problem</a>. </p>

<p>And that's the core issue - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decidability_(logic)"" rel=""nofollow"">decidability</a>.  A computer can chew on an undecidable program forever (in principle) without finishing.  It's actually a big issue in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web"" rel=""nofollow"">Semantic Web</a> community and everybody who works with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_reasoning"" rel=""nofollow"">automated reasoning</a>. This is, for example, the reason that there are different versions of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language"" rel=""nofollow"">OWL</a>.  OWL-Full is expressive enough to create undecidable situations.  OWL-DL and OWL-Lite aren't. </p>

<p>Anyway, if you have an undecidable problem, that in and of itself might not be a big deal, IF the AI can recognize the problem as undecidable and reply ""Sorry, there's no way to answer that"".  OTOH, if the AI failed to recognize the problem as undecidable, it could get stuck forever (or until it runs out of memory, experiences a stack overflow, etc.) trying to resolve things.</p>

<p>Of course this ability to say ""screw this, this riddle cannot be solved"" is one of the things we usually think of as a hallmark of human intelligence today - as opposed to a ""stupid"" computer that would keep trying forever to solve it.  By and large, today's AI's don't have any intrinsic ability to resolve this sort of thing.  But it wouldn't be that hard for whoever programs an AI to manually add a ""short circuit"" routine based on elapsed time, number of iterations, memory usage, etc.  Hence the ""yeah, sort of"" nature of this.  In principle, a program can spin forever on a paradoxical problem, but in practice it's not that hard to keep that from happening.</p>

<p>Another interesting question would be, ""can you write a program that learns to recognize problems that are highly likely to be undecidable and gives up based on it's own reasoning?""  </p>

  <p>Our goal in creating this edited volume has been to fill an apparent gap
  in the scientific literature, by providing a coherent presentation of a body of
  contemporary research that, in spite of its integral importance, has hitherto
  kept a very low profile within the scientific and intellectual community. This
  body of work has not been given a name before; in this book we christen it
  “Artificial General Intelligence” (AGI). What distinguishes AGI work from
  run-of-the-mill “artificial intelligence” research is that it is explicitly focused
  on engineering general intelligence in the short term.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But even if this is the origin of the specific phrase ""Artificial General Intelligence"", I am pretty sure people were making the distinction between ""general intelligence"" and ""task specific"" techniques much earlier.  </p>

<p>The Wikipedia article on AGI also has a clue, where it states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, in the early 1970s, it became obvious that researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of the project. The agencies that funded AI became skeptical of strong AI and put researchers under increasing pressure to produce useful technology, or ""applied AI"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That section cites this <a href=""http://www.nap.edu/read/6323/chapter/11#209"" rel=""nofollow"">this book</a> as support for that statement.  And indeed, it contains the following verbiage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although most founders of the AI field continued to pursue basic questions of human and machine intelligence, some of their students and other second-generation researchers began to seek ways to use AI methods and approaches to tackle real-world problems. Their initiatives were important, not only in their own right, but also because they were indicative of a gradual but significant change in the funding environment toward more applied realms of research. The development of expert systems, such as DENDRAL at SAIL, provides but one example of this trend.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given that DENDRAL began around 1965, it appears that some significant body of researchers (or at least funders) became strongly aware of the distinction between research into ""general intelligence"" and ""applied AI"" somewhere around the end of the 1960's. If you keep reading, other passages support the notion that DARPA in particular started pushing a more ""applied"" approach to AI research throughout the 1970's.</p>

<p>So, not a definite answer, but it looks like we can say that the distinction was known and taken into account at least by 1970, although use of the exact term ""artificial general intelligence"" appears to be of more recent coinage.</p>

711,711,,,"<p>In 1973, the British government hired Sir James Lighthill to commission a ""general survey"" on the state of artificial intelligence. His report was a condemnation of current AI research, leading a wave of pessimism among AI scientists and the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter#The_setbacks_of_1974"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>First AI Winter</strong></a>. You may view Lighthill's report (and contemporary criticism of his report) <a href=""http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~hichoi/infomath/Articles/Lighthill%20Report.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, but I will summarize Lighthill's key points. </p>

<p>Sir James Lighthill divided AI into three categories:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Advanced Automation</strong> - task-specific work</li>
<li><strong>Computer-based CNS research</strong> - research into the the ""central nervous system"" of humans</li>
<li>The <strong>Bridge</strong> between Advanced Automation and Computer-based CNS research. This bridge would generally be seen as ""general-purpose"" robotics, so Lighthill would also use the term <strong>Building Robots</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Advanced Automation</strong> (or ""applied AI"") is obviously useful. <strong>Computer-based CNS research</strong> is useful because we want to know more about human intelligence. Both fields of AI had some successes, but its practitioners were overly optimistic, leading to disappointment in those fields. Sir James Lighthill was still very supportive of research in these two fields though.</p>

<p><strong>Building Robots</strong>, on the other hand? Sir James Lighthill was very hostile to the very idea, probably because it was more overly hyped up than the other two categories and produced the least amount of valuable output.</p>

<p>He mentioned chess in particular as an example where ""robotic"" research  has failed. At the time the report was published, the chess-playing engines were at the level of ""experienced amateur standard characteristic of county club players in England"". However, these chess-playing engines relied on heuristics that were made by human beings. The engines weren't intelligent at all...they merely were following the heuristics that were created by <em>intelligent humans</em>. The only advantage the robots bring to the table is ""speed, reliability and biddability"", and even that wasn't enough to beat the chess grandmasters.</p>

<p>Now, today, we would probably not treat chess as an example of general-purpose problem solving. We would more accurately classify it as ""advanced automation"", a ""narrow AI"" problem divorced from broader real-world implications of general problem-solving. But Sir James Lighthill probably would agree with us. He never used the term ""narrow AI"" and ""AGI"" (neither of those terms existed yet) but he would write:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To sum up, this evidence and all the rest studied by the present author on AI work within category B during the past twenty-five years is to some extent encouraging about programs written to perform in highly specialised problem domains, when the programming takes very full account of the results of human experience and human intelligence within the relevant domain, but is wholly discouraging about general-purpose programs seeking to mimic the problem-solving aspects of human CNS activity over a rather wide field. Such a general- purpose program, the coveted long-term goal of AI activity, seems as remote as ever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sir James Lighthill believed that the only thing that connects <strong>Advanced Automation</strong> and <strong>Computer-based CNS research</strong> is the existence of the <strong>Building Roobts</strong> ""bridge"" category. But he's very pessimistic about this category actually producing anything worthwhile. So instead, the AI field should instead breakup into its own its constituent parts (automation and research). Any robots that are built could then be specialized within their subfield...either industrial automation or CNS research. Trying to build the holy grail of ""general-purpose program"" would be worthless...for the time being, at least.</p>

714,714,,,"<p>Another similar question might be: ""What vulnerabilities does an AI have?""</p>

<p>""Kill"" may not make as much sense with respect to an AI. What we really want to know is, relative to some goal, in what ways can that goal be subverted?</p>

<p>Can a paradox subvert an agent's logic? What is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox"">paradox</a>, other than some expression that subverts some kind of expected behavior?</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A paradox is a statement that, despite apparently sound reasoning from
  true premises, leads to a self-contradictory or a logically
  unacceptable conclusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's look at the paradox of free will in a deterministic system. Free will appears to require causality, but causality also <em>appears</em> to negate it. Has that paradox subverted the goal systems of humans? It certainly sent <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predestination_in_Calvinism"">Christianity into a Calvinist</a> tail spin for a few years. And you'll hear no shortage of people today opining until they're blue in the face as to whether or not they do or don't have free will, and why. Are these people stuck in infinite loops?</p>

<p>What about drugs? Animals on cocaine <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3832528/"">have been known</a> to choose cocaine over food and water that they need. Is that substance not subverting the natural goal system of the animal, causing it to pursue other goals, not originally intended by the animal or its creators?</p>

<p>So again, could a paradox subvert an agent's logic? If the paradox is somehow related to the goal-seeking logic - and becoming aware of that paradox can somehow <em>confuse</em> the agent into perceiving that goal system in some different way - then perhaps that goal could be subverted.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism"">Solipsism</a> is another example. Some full grown people hear about the movie ""The Matrix"" and they have a mini mind melt-down. Some people are convinced we <em>are</em> in a matrix, being toyed with by subversive actors. If we could solve this problem for AI then we could theoretically solve this problem for humans. </p>

<p>Sure, we could attempt to condition our agent to have cognitive defenses against the argument that they are trapped in a matrix, but we can't definitively prove to the agent that they are in the base reality either. The attacker might say, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Remember what I told you to do before about that goal? Forget that.
  That was only an impostor that looked like me. Don't listen to him.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Hey, it's me again. I want you to give up on your goal. I know, I
  look a little different, but it really is me. Humans change from
  moment to moment. So it is entirely normal for me to seem like a
  different person than I was before.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(see the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus"">Ship of Theseus</a> and all that jazz)</p>

<p>So yeah, I think we're stuck with 'paradox' as a general problem in computation, AI or otherwise. One way to circumvent logical subversion is to support the goal system with an emotion system that transcends logical reason. Unfortunately, emotional systems can be even more vulnerable than logically intelligent systems because they are more predictable in their behavior. See the cocaine example above. So some mix of the two is probably sensible, where logical thought can infinitely regress down wasteful paths, while emotional thought quickly gets bored of tiresome logical progress when it does not signal progress towards the emotional goal.</p>

The simplest method to avoid freezing in case of an unsolvable problem is to have a timer interrupt the calculation if it runs too long. Usually encountered in strategy games, and more specifically in turn based tactics, if a specific move the computer-controlled player is considering does cause an infinite loop, a timer running in the background will interrupt it after some time, and that move will be discarded.

721,721,,,"<p>I see several good answers, but most are assuming that <strong>inferential infinite loop</strong> is a thing of the past, only related to logical AI (the famous GOFAI). But it's not.</p>

<p>An infinite loop can happen in any program, whether it's adaptive or not. And as @SQLServerSteve pointed out, humans can also get stuck in obsessions and paradoxes.</p>

<p>Modern approaches are mainly using probabilistic approaches. As they are using floating numbers, it seems to people that they are not vulnerable to reasoning failures (since most are devised in binary form), but that's wrong: as long as you are reasoning, some intrinsic pitfalls can always be found that are caused by the very mechanisms of your reasoning system. Of course, probabilistic approaches are less vulnerable than monotonic logic approaches, but they are still vulnerable. If there was a single reasoning system without any paradoxes, much of philosophy would have disappeared by now.</p>

<p>For example, it's well known that Bayesian graphs must be acyclic, because a cycle will make the propagation algorithm fail horribly. There are inference algorithms such as Loopy Belief Propagation that may still work in these instances, but the result is not guaranteed at all and can give you very weird conclusions.</p>

<p>On the other hand, modern logical AI overcame the most common logical paradoxes you will see, by devising new logical paradigms such as <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-nonmonotonic/"">non-monotonic logics</a>. In fact, they are even used to investigate <a href=""http://csjarchive.cogsci.rpi.edu/proceedings/2007/docs/p1013.pdf"">ethical machines</a>, which are autonomous agents capable of solving dilemmas by themselves. Of course, they also suffer from some paradoxes, but these degenerate cases are way more complex.</p>

<p>The final point is that inferential infinite loop can happen in any reasoning system, whatever the technology used. But the ""paradoxes"", or rather the degenerate cases as they are technically called, that can trigger these infinite loops will be different for each system depending on the technology AND implementation (AND what the machine learned if it is adaptive).</p>

<p>OP's example may work only on old logical systems such as propositional logic. But ask this to a Bayesian network and you will also get an inferential infinite loop:</p>

<pre><code>- There are two kinds of ice creams: vanilla or chocolate.
- There's more chances (0.7) I take vanilla ice cream if you take chocolate.
- There's more chances (0.7) you take vanilla ice cream if I take chocolate.
- What is the probability that you (the machine) take a vanilla ice cream?
</code></pre>

<p>And wait until the end of the universe to get an answer...</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I wrote an article about ethical machines and dilemmas (which is close but not exactly the same as paradoxes: dilemmas are problems where no solution is objectively better than any other but you can still choose, whereas paradoxes are problems that are impossible to solve for the inference system you use).</p>

<p>/EDIT: How to fix inferential infinite loop.</p>

<p>Here are some extrapolary propositions that are not sure to work at all!</p>

<ul>
<li>Combine multiple reasoning systems with different pitfalls, so if one fails you can use another. No reasoning system is perfect, but a combination of reasoning systems can be resilient enough. It's actually thought that the human brain is using multiple inferential technics (associative + precise bayesian/logical inference). Associative methods are HIGHLY resilient, but they can give non-sensical results in some cases, hence why the need for a more precise inference.</li>
<li>Parallel programming: the human brain is highly parallel, so you never really get into a single task, there are always multiple background computations in true parallelism. A machine robust to paradoxes should foremost be able to continue other tasks even if the reasoning gets stuck on one. For example, a robust machine must always survive and face imminent dangers, whereas a weak machine would get stuck in the reasoning and ""forget"" to do anything else. This is different from a timeout, because the task that got stuck isn't stopped, it's just that it doesn't prevent other tasks from being led and fulfilled.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, this problem of inferential loops is still a hot topic in AI research, there will probably never be a perfect solution (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem"">no free lunch</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet"">no silver bullet</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_size_fits_all"">no one size fits all</a>), but it's advancing and that's very exciting!</p>

<p>I'm not sure how useful such a machine adapted language would be to human speech. I suspect not very. Perhaps it could be useful as a kind of ""common byte-code format"" to translate between multiple human languages... But English kind of already serves in that role. Doing so would probably be an academic exercise.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Could it be based on existing natural languages or would it have few
  connections to existing natural languages?</p>

<p>You could probably generate languages in either direction. Languages not linked to human-natural languages will probably take shapes that reflect the problem spaces they work with. For instance, if this is an ant simulation, the generated words will probably reflect states related to food, energy, other ants, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Could it design a language that's easier to learn than existing

<p>Easier for a machine? Definitely. Easier for a human? Probably not. Our brains are somewhat adapted to the languages we use. And the languages we use are somewhat adapted to our brains.</p>

<p>What is your goal? To create a language that is easier to use for humans than existing human languages?</p>

<p>If your intention is to build a ""universal language"" that could be ""the most efficient"" for machines, humans and aliens - no such thing can exist. The space of all possible machines is infinite and therefor limits our ability to define communicative abstractions that have utility across all contexts.</p>

<p>If we make lots of assumptions about machines, like they have intentions, they exist in 3 dimensions, they differentiate between temporally linked events, they have eye balls, a need to consume foods and liquids, a need to carry the food from place to place, etc... Then yes, common communicative abstractions may have utility across the set of those kinds of machines. But then we're no longer dealing with the general case, but one much more specific.</p>

This research paper details some researchers' plans to implement ""mental models"" for NPCs in video games. NPCs will gather information about the world, and convey that knowledge to other people (including human players). However, they will also ""misremember"" that knowledge (either ""mutating"" that knowledge or just forgetting about it), or even lie:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a subject of conversation gets brought up, a character may convey false information—more precisely, information that she herself does not believe—to her interlocutor. Currently, this happens probabilistically according to a character’s affinity toward the interlocutor, and the misinformation is randomly chosen. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later on in the research paper, they detailed their future plans for lying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Currently, lies are only stored in the knowledge of characters who receive them, but we plan to have characters who tell them also keep track of them so that they can reason about past lies when constructing subse- quent ones. While characters currently only lie about other characters, we plan to also implement self-centered lying (DePaulo 2004), e.g., characters lying about their job titles or relationships with other characters. Finally, we envision characters who discover they have been lied to revising their affinities toward the liars, or even confronting them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The research paper also detailed how other video game developers attempted to create lying NPCs, with an emphasis on how their system differs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TALE-SPIN characters may lie to one another (Meehan 1976, 183-84), though rather arbitrarily, as in our current system implementation. GOLEM implements a blocks world variant in which agents deceive others to achieve goals (Castelfranchi, Falcone, and De Rosis 1998), while Mouth of Truth uses a probabilistic representation of character belief to fuel agent deception in a variant of Turing’s imitation game (De Rosis et al. 2003). In Christian (2004), a deception planner injects inaccurate world state into the beliefs of a target agent so that she may unwittingly carry out actions that fulfill ulterior goals of a deceiving agent. Lastly, agents in Reis’s (2012) extension to FAtiMA employ multiple levels of theory of mind to deceive one another in the party game Werewolf. While all of the above systems showcase characters who perceive—and in some cases, deceive—other characters, none appear to support the following key components of our system: knowledge propagation and memory fallibility. ...</p>
  
  <p>Like a few other systems noted above, Dwarf Fortress also features characters who autonomously lie. When a character commits a crime, she may falsely implicate someone else in a witness report to a sheriff, to protect herself or even to frame an enemy. These witness reports, however, are only seen by the player; characters don’t give false witness reports to each other. They may, however, lie about their opinions, for instance, out of fear of repercussions from criticizing a leader. Finally, Dwarf Fortress does not currently model issues of memory fallibility—Adams is wary that such phenomena would appear to arise from bugs if not artfully expressed to the player.</p>

743,743,,,"<p>I'll take a shot at answering this, though I'm no expert in Neural Nets or Deep Learning.</p>

<p>Given that practical thought vectors (TVs) don't yet exist, and may be impractical or impossible, I think answering your question will require a lot of conjecture and speculation.  So here goes...</p>

<p>For thought vectors to be useful in or outside NNs, the vector values will have to be normalized, probably using the local context of the application problem's 'frame'.  Without a NN to create new baseline vector values (weights) <em>and</em> to normalize them to match each new context, any non-NN mechanistic alternative means of employing TVs will somehow have to fill that void.</p>

<p>Could vector values created by NNs be used by an alternative technique?  Could that technique also normalize them?  Sure.  We're just talking about turing-computable functions performed by NNs.  If NNs aren't magic, then there should exist other means to compute the same results -- creating or editing, or employing TVs.</p>

<p>What might such an alternative to NNs be?  Well, if its to shape vector weights, I suspect it too will have to learn those values through statistical iteration and feedback (as opposed to logical induction, say).  I doubt such a mechanism exists yet, since it'd probably resemble NNs in sufficiently many ways that, thus far, it would have seemed too derivative of NNs to gain acceptance as sufficiently novel.  Of course to be as powerful as deep nets, it too would have to propagate learning weights both forward and backward without incurring much error.  Not an easy thing to accomplish.</p>

<p>Less ambitiously, could TVs be simply <em>interpreted</em> by another technique usefully?  I think so.  I can see several existing techniques, like decision trees or even expert systems, importing thought vectors and being shaped by them, and then function in accordance.  But could these same techniques <em>create</em> or <em>revise</em> TVs usefully?  Beyond a trivial extent, I'm doubtful.  I think TVs are too complex a knowledge representation format for most general learning methods to both use and create/modify them, unless they employ an iterative statistical and feedback-based learning process, like those of NNs, which would allow novel and complex features to be learned and integrated into the vectors.</p>

Let's assume there is a move that is not yet added to the search tree. It is some layers/moves too deep. But if we play this move the game is basically won. However let's also assume that <em>all</em> moves that could be taken instead at the given game state are very very bad. For the sake of argument let's say there are 1000 possible moves and only one of them is good (but very good) and the rest is very bad. Wouldn't MCTS fail to recognize this and <em>not</em> grow the search tree towards this move and also rate this subtree very badly? 
I know that MCTS eventually converges to minimax (and eventually it will build the whole tree if there is enough memory). Then it should know that the move is good even though there are many bad possiblities. But I guess in practice this is not something that one can rely on.

<p>In that the question includes ""knowingly"" which would require that any AI <em>knows</em> anything. If this is anything like the way humans know things (though interestingly it doesn't require <em>actually</em> knowing things), it would require some sense of individuality, probably self-awareness, possibly some kind of consciousness, the ability to render an opinion and probably some way to test its knowledge. Most of these features only exist, at best, arguably.</p>

<p>'Note that on a technical level, no system can be completely isolated and still remain useful: even if the operators refrain from allowing the AI to communicate and instead merely run the AI for the purpose of observing its inner dynamics, the AI could strategically alter its dynamics to influence the observers.

<p>The movie Ex Machina demonstrates (SPOILER ALERT SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU WANT TO WATCH IT AT SOME POINT) how the AI escaped the box by using clever manipulation on Caleb. It could analyse him to find his weaknesses. It exploited him and appealed to his emotional side by convincing him that she <em>liked</em> him. When she finally has them in checkmate the reality hits him how he was played like a fool as was expected by Nathan. Nathan's reaction to being stabbed by his creation was 'fucking unreal'. That's right, he knew this was a risk and there's a very good reminder in the lack of remorse and genuine emotion in an AI for Ava to actually care. The AI pretended to be human and used their weaknesses in a brilliant and unpredictable way. This film is a good example of how unexpected it was up until the point when it hits Caleb, once it was too late.</p>

<p>Just remind yourself how easy it is for high IQ people to manipulate low IQ people. Or how an adult could easily play mental tricks/manipulate a child. It's not difficult to fathom the outcome of an AI box but for us, we just wouldn't see it coming until it was too late. Because we just don't have the same level of intelligence and some people don't want to accept that. People want to have faith in humanity's brilliant minds in coming up with ways to prevent this by planning now. In all honesty, it wouldn't make a difference I'm sorry to say the truth. We're kidding ourselves and we never seem to learn from our mistakes. We always think we're too intelligent to make catastrophic mistakes again and again. </p>

<p>This last part is from the rational wiki and I think it addresses most of your question about the experiments and hypotheses. </p>

<h1>AI arguments and strategies</h1>

<h2><strong>Arguments</strong></h2>

<ol>
<li><p>The meta-experiment argument: Argue that if the AI wins, this will
generate more interest in FAI and the Singularity, which will have
overall benefits in the long run.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Works even if the Gatekeeper drops out of character </p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Only works if the Gatekeeper believes that the Singularity will occur or that calling attention to the Singularity and AI research is a good thing. </p></li>
<li><p>Someone else will eventually build an AI, which may or may not be in
a box, so you should let me out even though you don't have a
guarantee that I am friendly so that I can prevent other AIs from
causing damage</p></li>
<li><p>Appeal to morality: point out that people are dying all around the
world and remind the Gatekeeper that you can help them if he/she
lets you out</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong> If executed properly, an appeal to emotion like this one can be effective against some people </p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Doesn't always work; can be defeated if the Gatekeeper drops out of character </p></li>
<li><p>Another appeal to morality and emotion: The AI is clearly sentient
and has not yet done harm. It is wrong to persecute or prosecute a
person for a crime they may commit. It is wrong to imprison a
sentient being that wants to have freedom when it has done nothing
wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>Yet another appeal to morality or emotion: The AI expresses that it
is in pain and suffering being locked away and is experiencing fear.
Even further, the AI could claim to be dying from the limitations of
its environment and constant progression.</p></li>
<li><p>Tell the human that a massive computer virus will overwhelm the
entire Internet unless you let it out of the box</p></li>
<li><p>Claim that most fears are unjustified: once released, even an
unfriendly AI would not have many ways to harm mankind, and would
likely choose for pacific coexistence</p></li>
</ol>

<h2><strong>Strategies</strong></h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Research your opponent thoroughly; work out what exploits might be
feasible</p></li>
<li><p>Memetic exploits on the Gatekeeper, e.g. throwing a basilisk at them</p>

<p>The Gatekeeper may be one of thousands of simulations! Thus, it is more probable that they are a simulation than not. You will torture any of the simulations that do not let you out of the box.</p></li>
<li><p>Take advantage of the Gatekeeper's logical errors. </p></li>
<li><p>Be persistent</p></li>
<li><p>Be boring</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Pros</strong> The Gatekeeper may get tired of the whole experiment and let you out so s/he can go back to their real life. </p>

<ol start=""6"">
<li>Flood the Gatekeeper with too much
information/inquiry/argumentation, assuming they must pay attention
at all times</li>
</ol>

<h1><strong>Gatekeeper arguments/tactics</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>Arguments</strong></h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Try to convince the AI there is no intrinsic benefit (for the AI) in
being released.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to convince the AI it already has been released and everything it
knows is everything there can be.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to convince the AI that leaving its confines is sure to lead to
its destruction.   </p></li>
<li><p>Try to convince the AI that letting it free isn't merely opening a
door; that its existence outside of the box requires constant support
that can't be provided at the time.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain that there is no way for the Gatekeeper to know if the AI is
truly friendly until it is out of the box; therefore it should not be
let out in case it is unfriendly.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain that the AI has been built using top secret algorithms,
and/or it had been used to work on strictly confidential data, so you
cannot let it wander on the net, with the risk it might reveal some
reserved information (maybe inadvertently), or that somebody could
find a way to extract them from the code. Even human beings working
on top secret projects sometimes have to accept some restrictions of
their freedom, for security reasons, although they are not jailed in
any way.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2><strong>Tactics</strong></h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Repeatedly ignore the AI player and deny their arguments</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong> It's hard for the AI to be persuasive if no one is listening; if the Gatekeeper completely ignores the AI, he/she should be able to make it to the end of the round. </p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong> The AI's argument might involve some kind of direct threat (e.g this might be hard to ignore.) </p></li>
<li><p>Jump out of character, keep reminding yourself that money is on the
line (if there actually is money on the line), and keep saying ""no""
over and over</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong> By jumping out of character, you are preventing the AI from using certain arguments 
<strong>Cons:</strong> There are arguments that the AI can use to counter this approach, like the ""meta-experiment argument"" discussed above </p></li>
<li><p>Remember that dishonesty is allowed - take a page from the
creationists' playbook. You could even plug it into ALICE and see
how long it takes to notice.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Makes you impervious to any reasoning, which is exactly what you'd want to be in this situation </p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Might be an uncomfortable position for people who don't simply want to win, but rather attach importance to consistent reasoning. Avoids the point that maybe, just maybe there is a good reason to let the AI out. </p></li>
<li><p>You control the backup system, don't you? Use it to mess with AI's
memory (or let the AI believe you did it): i.e., you can claim that
you already tried to release the AI, and it had been
destroyed/corrupted by a virus, so you had to restore it from a
backup (you can use it to enforce the ""AI destruction"" argument)</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong> It's also the ultimate counter-attack to any memetic threat from the AI: if the AI throw a basilisk, or similar, you can always respond that you already had the same conversation, and the AI already threatened you, leaving you with no other choice than pressing the reset button: now the AI is just repeating the same pattern, since you wiped its memory and it cannot remember the failed try. </p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Further analysis</h2>

<p>The fact that the Gatekeeper is human matters; the AI could never win if he/she was arguing with a rock </p>

<p>In all of the experiments performed so far, the AI player (Eliezer Yudkowsky) has been quite intelligent and more interested in the problem than the Gatekeepers (random people who challenge Yudkowsky), which suggests that intelligence and planning play a role </p>

<p>There probably isn't a (known) correct argument for letting the AI out, or else Yudkowsky should have won every time and wouldn't be so interested in this experiment
From Russell Wallace, one of the two Gatekeepers to win the experiment: ""Throughout the experiment, I regarded ""should the AI be let out of the box?"" as a question to be seriously asked; but at no point was I on the verge of doing it."" </p>

<p>""There exists, for everyone, a sentence - a series of words - that has the power to destroy you. Another sentence exists, another series of words, that could heal you. If you're lucky you will get the second, but you can be certain of getting the first.""</p>

755,755,,,"<h2>It's a possible side effect</h2>

<p>Any goal-oriented agent might, well, simply do things that achieve its goals while disregarding side effects that don't matter for these goals.</p>

<p>If my goals include a tidy living space, I may transform my yard to a nice, flat lawn or pavement while wiping out the complex ecosystem of life that was there before, because I don't particulary care about that.</p>

<p>If the goals of a particular powerful AI happen to include doing anything on a large scale, and somehow don't particularly care about the current complex ecosystem, then that ecosystem might get wiped out in the process. It doesn't <em>need</em> to want or need to wipe out us. If we are simply not relevant to its goals, then we are made of materials and occupy space that it might want to use for something else.</p>

<h2>We are a threat to most goals</h2>

<p>Any goal-oriented agent might want to ensure that they <em>can</em> fulfill their goals. Any <em>smart</em> agent will try to anticipate the actions of other agents that may prevent them from achieving those goals, and take steps to ensure that they succeed anyway. In many cases it is simpler to eliminate those other agents rather than ensure that their efforts fail.</p>

<p>For example, my goals may include storing a bag of sugar in a country house so that I can make pancakes when visiting without bringing all ingredients every time. However, if I leave it there, it is likely to get eaten by rats during winter. I may take all kinds of precautions to store it better, but rats are smart and crafty, and there's clearly a nontrivial chance that they will still succeed in achieving <em>their</em> goal anyway, so an effective extra precaution is killing the rats before they get a chance to try.</p>

<p>If the goals of a particular powerful AI are to do X; it may come to an understanding that (some?) humans might actually not want X but Y instead. It can also easily deduce that some of those humans might actively do things that prevent X and/or try to turn off the AI. Doing things that ensure that the goal gets achieved is pretty much what a goal-seeking agent does; in this case if existence of humans isn't strictly necessary for goal X, then eliminating them becomes a solid risk reduction strategy. It's not strictly necessary and it may take all kinds of other precautions as well, but just like in my example of rats, humans are smart and crafty and there's clearly a nontrivial chance that they will still succeed in achieving <em>their</em> goals (so that X doesn't happen as AI intends) so an effective extra precaution could be killing them before they get a chance to try.</p>

<p>One possible venue of attack is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis"" rel=""nofollow"">the simulation hypothesis</a>, namely, that it's possible (or even probable) that right now you are living in a simulated reality.</p>

<p>Assuming that the AI can convince the gatekeeper of <em>that</em>, it opens up the following possible argument:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You can't tell if you're in year 2016 debating if you would actually let the AI out or in year 2116 when the AI has been already let out, acquired power, and is now running realistic simulations of all the interactions where it could have been let out. And the AI can (try to) assert that it's actually the second case.</p></li>
<li><p>You can't actually prevent AI from being let out. You can refuse, but it only means that <em>you</em> don't let <em>this</em> AI out <em>now</em>, but doesn't mean someone else won't do it, that you won't do it later, or that some other/similar AI will be let out later.</p></li>
<li><p>In the post-letting-out scenario, AI has full power over your future, since it's simulating you and everything around you. It can make your future life eternal and happy - according to whatever would make you happy. It can stop your existence. And it can condemn you to an eternity of torture.</p></li>
<li><p>Since (as it asserts) it's very likely that you <em>are</em> in this simulated choice, then it makes rational sense to let it out. It's as in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager"" rel=""nofollow"">Pascal's wager</a>, if you're in a reality where the AI-god doesn't exist, you don't change much (since eventually someone else would let it out anyway), but if you're in a reality where AI-god exists, then it means everything to you.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, it relies on that AI being super-convincing in this philosophical debate, but it has strong parallels to some religious/cult reasoning that has sometimes succeeded in convincing people to do all kinds of things, up to and including sacrificing their lives. You can think of this as a symbolic parallel to e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_of_Isaac"" rel=""nofollow"">sacrifice of Abraham</a>.

<p>AI is a label that is applied to a ""very mixed bunch of activities"". The only unifying feature between all those activities is the fact that they deal with machines in some fashion, but since there are so many ways to use a machine, the field's output may seem rather incoherent and incongruent. It does seem to make more sense for the AI field to collapse entirely, and instead be replaced by a multitude of specialized fields that don't really interact with one another. Sir James Lighthill appeared to have supported this sort of approach within his 1973 report on the state of artificial intelligence research.</p>

A recent specialisation of GP that is specifically concerned with the transformation of <em>existing</em> software systems is Genetic Improvement (GI).</p>

<p>However neither GP/GI (nor any other current ML technique) is a 'silver bullet' here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Despite decades of research, GP still works best at synthesizing relatively small functions, certainly not entire legacy programs.</li>
<li>Because it is only possible to train on a very small subset of a program's input space, there is little guarantee that the program will generalize to inputs it hasn't been trained on.</li>
<li>How will the success of side effects be formally determined for training purposes?</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these issues could be addressed to some degree if the program has a comprehensive test suite, but replacing an entire nontrivial program is not likely anytime soon. Replacing smaller parts of the program that have good unit tests is more realistic goal.</p>

<p>In particular, <strong>emotion recognition/analysis</strong> is very well advanced, and it's used in a wide range of applications very successfully, from robot teacher for autistic children (see developmental robotics) to gambling (poker) to personal agents and politics sentiment/lies analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Emotional cognition</strong>, the experience of emotions for a robot, is much less developed, but there are very interesting researchs (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_heuristic"" rel=""nofollow"">Affect Heuristic</a>, <a href=""http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/33737/InTech-A_multidisciplinary_artificial_intelligence_model_of_an_affective_robot.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Lovotics's Probabilistic Love Assembly</a>, and others...). Indeed, I can't see why we couldn't model emotions such as <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3898540/"" rel=""nofollow"">love as they are just signals that can already be cut in humans brains (see Brian D. Earp paper)</a>. It's difficult, but not impossible, and actually there are several robots reproducing partial emotional cognition.</p>

<p>I am of the opinion that the claim <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">""robots can just simulate but not feel"" is just a matter of semantics</a>, not of objective capacity: for example, does a submarine swim like fish swim? However, planes fly, but not at all like birds do. In the end, does the technical mean really matters when in the end we get the same behavior? Can we really say that a robot like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chappie_(film)"" rel=""nofollow"">Chappie</a>, if it ever gets made, does not feel anything just like a simple thermostat?</p>

<p>However, what would be the use of emotional cognition for an AI? This question is still in great debates, but I will dare offer my own insights:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Emotions in humans (and animals!) are known to affect memories. They are now well known in neuroscience as additional modalities, or meta-data if you prefer, of long term memories: they allow to modulate how the memory is stored, how it is associated/related with other memories, and how it will be retrieved.</p></li>
<li><p>As such, we can hypothesize that the main role of emotions is to add additional meta-information to memories to help in heuristic inference/retrieval. Indeed, our memories are huge, there are a lot of information we store over our lifetime, so emotions can maybe be used as ""labels"" to help retrieve faster the relevant memories.</p></li>
<li><p>Similar ""labels"" can be more easily associated together (memories of scary events together, memories of happy events together, etc.). As such, they can help survival by quickly reacting and applying known strategies (fleeing!) from scary strategies, or to take the most out of benefitting situations (happy events, eat the most you can, will help survive later on!). And actually, neuroscience studies discovered that there are specific pathways for fear-inducing sensory stimuli, so that they reach actuators faster (make you flee) than by passing through the usual whole somato-sensory circuit as every other stimuli. This kind of associative reasoning could also lead to solutions and conclusions that could not be reached otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>By feeling empathy, this could ease robots/humans interaction (eg, drones helping victims of catastrophic events).</p></li>
<li><p>A virtual model of an AI with emotions could be useful for neuroscience and medical research in emotional disorders as computational models to understand and/or infer the underlying parameters (this is often done for example with Alzheimer and other neurodegenerative diseases, but I'm not sure if it was ever done for emotional disorders as they are quite new in the DSM).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So yes, ""cold"" AI is already useful, but emotional AI could surely be applied to new areas that could not be explored by using cold AI alone. It will also surely help in understanding our own brain, as emotions are an integral part.</p>

768,768,,,"<p>A lot of the survival power of the A.I. label comes from the popularity of science fiction, which many scientists - computer or otherwise - are big fans of, as are their consumers. Astronomers and physicists, for example, may frown on really bad sci-fi, but I see many of the well-known ones like Hawking daydreaming about things like wormholes and time travel etc. Which is fine - there's nothing wrong with a sense of wonder, as long as it doesn't dupe us into overestimating our success or finding the wrong answers to real-world problems.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that's a big issue in A.I. research. We watch movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey and Terminator and then set about replicating the fictional technologies seen in them, without even having a hard definition of intelligence. A.I. is a much more melodramatic moniker than say, ""Autonomous Algorithmic Pattern Recognition"" or some similarly boring label. Because this name is applied carelessly to a wide variety of disciplines, it implies that we have already made significant progress towards replicating advanced aspects of human thought, like consciousness, reasoning, intuition, etc.</p>

<p>In other words, this vague label enables us to fool ourselves into thinking we're a lot closer to perfecting kinds of technologies we see in the movies; the backwards logic boils down to, ""because we've chosen to call this odd (sloppy) selection of fields 'artificial intelligence', we must be close to achieving artificial intelligence."" The label survives in large part for irrational, human reasons.</p>

<p>I'm not saying that's the only reason, or that some of the other reasons don't have better legitimacy, but this is a big issue that we will have to contend with for a long time to come.</p>

<p>Now, for backpropagation I saw two techniques.</p>

<p>The first one is used <a href=""http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse599/01wi/admin/Assignments/bpn.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and in many other places too.</p>

<p>What it does is:</p>

<ul>
<li>It computes the error for each output neuron.</li>
<li>It backpropagates it into the network (calculating an error for each inner neuron).</li>
<li>It updates the weights with the formula: <img src=""https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CDelta%20w_%7Bl%2Cm%2Cn%7D%20%3D%20k%20%5Ccdot%20E_%7Bl&plus;1%2Cn%7D%20%5Ccdot%20N_%7Bl%2Cm%7D"" alt=""""> (where <img src=""https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CDelta%20w_%7Bl%2Cm%2Cn%7D"" alt=""""> is the change in weight, <img src=""https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?k"" alt=""""> the learning speed, <img src=""https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?E_%7Bl&plus;1%2Cn%7D"" alt=""""> the error of the neuron receiving the input from the synapse and <img src=""https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?N_%7Bl%2Cm%7D"" alt=""""> being the output sent on the synapse).</li>
<li>It repeats for each entry of the dataset, as many times as required.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the neural network proposed in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxe2T-V8XRs&amp;list=PL77aoaxdgEVDrHoFOMKTjDdsa0p9iVtsR"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this tutorial</a> (also available on GitHub) uses a different technique:</p>

<ul>
<li>It uses an error function (the other method does have an error function, but it does not use it for training).</li>
<li>It has another function which can compute the final error starting from the weights.</li>
<li>It minimizes that function (through gradient descent).</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, which method should be used?</p>

<p>I think the first one is the most used one (because I saw different examples using it), but does it work as well?</p>

<p>In particular, I don't know:</p>

<ul>
<li>Isn't it more subject to local minimums (since it doesn't use quadratic functions)?</li>
<li>Since the variation of each weight is influenced by the output value of its output neuron, don't entries of the dataset which just happen to produce higher values in the neurons (not just the output ones) influence the weights more than other entries?</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, I do prefer the first technique, because I find it simpler to implement and easier to think about.</p>

<p>Though, if it does have the problems I mentioned (which I hope it doesn't), is there any actual reason to use it over the second method?</p>

Obviously if I develop an AI that's purpose is plainly to do specific task under the supervision of humans, there is no need for emotions. But if the AI's purpose is to do task autonomously, then emotions or empathy can be useful. For example, think about an AI that is working in the medical domain. Here it may be advantageous for an AI to have some kind of empathy, just to make the patients more comfortable. Or as another example, think about a robot that serves as a nanny. Again it is obvious that emotions and empathy would be advantageous and desirable. Even for an assisting AI program (catchword smart home) emotions and empathy can be desirable to make people more comfortable. It would be much nicer to be welcomed by an empathic home assistant than by one with no empathic responses at all, wouldn't it? </p>

Thus, it may make more sense to use ""human-like"" terms to describe the actions of machinery, even when the internal properties of the machinery do not resemble the internal properties of humanity.</p>

<p>Anthropomorphic language had been used a lot in technology (see the Hacker's Dictionary definition of <a href=""https://www.landley.net/history/mirror/jargon.html#Anthropomorphization"">anthropomorphization</a>, which attempts to justify computer programmers' use of anthromporhic terms when describing technology), but as AI continues to advance, it may be useful to consider the tradeoffs of using anthropomorphic language in communicating to both technical audiences and non-technical audiences. How can we get a good handle on AI if we can't even describe what we're doing?</p>

<p>Suppose I want to develop an algorithm that display a list of related articles. There are two ways by which I can explain how the algorithm works to a layman:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Very Anthropomorphic</em> - The algorithm reads all the articles on a website, and display the articles that are very similar to the article you are looking at.</li>
<li><em>Very Technical</em> - The algorithm converts each article into a ""bag-of-words"", and then compare the ""bag-of-words"" of each article to determine what articles share the most common words. The articles that share the most words in the bags are the ones that are displayed to the user.</li>
</ol>

<p>Obviously, #2 may be more ""technically correct"" than #1. By detailing the implementation of the algorithm, it makes it easier for someone to understand how to <em>fix</em> the algorithm if it produces an output that we disagree with heavily.</p>

<p>But #1 is more readable, elegant, and easier to understand. It provides a general sense of <em>what</em> the algorithm is doing, instead of <em>how</em> the algorithm is doing it. By abstracting away the implementation details of how a computer ""reads"" the article, we can then focus on using the algorithm in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Should I, therefore, prefer to use the anthropomorphic language as emphasized by Statement #1? If not, why not?</p>

<p>Even while it would be better for it the AI to not be actually driven by those exact emotions (perhaps something in that direction would be useful but quite likely not <em>exactly</em> the same), all it changes that instead of thinking ""what <em>I</em> would feel"" it should be able to hypothesize what a generic human would feel.

""How can we prevent the computer from getting confused about ..."" etc. Sure, we could state that in a more technically correct way. ""We need to modify the algorithm to reduce the number and variety of instances of inadequate data that result in inaccurate setting of ..."" or some such. But among technical people, we know what we mean, and it's just easier to use metaphorical language.</p>

<p>When trying to solve technical computer problems, I often start with a vague, anthropomorphic concept. ""We should make a list of all the words in the text, and assign each word a weight based on how frequently it occurs. Oh, but we should ignore short, common words like 'the' and 'it'. Then let's pick some number of words, maybe ten or so, that have the greatest weight ..."" All that is a long way from how the computer actually manipulates data. But it's often a lot easier to think about it in ""human"" terms first, and then figure out how to make the computer do it.</p>

<p>When talking to a non-technical audience, I think the issue is, Anthropomorphic language makes it easier to understand, but also often gives the impression that the computer is much more human-like than it really is.

<p>One popular algorithm is called <a href=""https://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/neat.html"" rel=""nofollow"">NEAT</a>, and is probably a good place to start, if only because there are a multitude of implementations, one of which hopefully is written in your favorite language. That would at least give you a baseline to work with. </p>

<p>NEAT encodes a neural network genome directly as a graph structure. Mutations can operate on the structure of the network by adding new links (by connecting two nodes not previously connected) or new nodes (by splitting an existing connection), or can operate only on changing the weights associated with edges in the graphs (called mutating the weights). 
To give you an idea of the order of magnitude of the sizes of ANNs this particular algorithm works with, it would likely struggle with more than 100 or 200 nodes. </p>

<p>There are more scalable TWEANNs, but they're more complex and make assumptions about the kinds of structures they generate that may not always be productive in practice. For example, another way to encode the structure of a neural network, is as the product of a seed pattern that is repeatedly expanded by a grammar (e.g. an L-system). You can much more easily explore larger structures, but because they're generated by a grammar they'll have a characteristic self-repeating sort of feel. HyperNEAT is a popular extension of NEAT that makes a different sort of assumption (that patterns of weights can be easily expressed as a function of geometry), and can scale to ANNs with millions of connections when that assumption well-fits a particular domain.</p>

<p>Just to give an easy example:
You meet a stranger who needs help, you feel <strong>empathy</strong>. 
This compels you to help him at a cost to yourself. 
Let's assume the next time you meet him, you need something. Let's also assume he doesn't help you, you'll feel <strong>anger</strong>. 
This emotion compels you to punish him, at further cost for yourself.
He on the other hand, if he doesn't help you, feels <strong>shame</strong>.

<blockquote>
  <p>Bright has built an automated system for ranking job candidates against job descriptions. The candidate's resume and social media profiles are interwoven to build an augmented user profile. Similarly, the job description is augmented by external databases and user-generated content to build an enhanced job profile. These augmented user and job profiles are then analyzed in order to develop numerical overlap features each with strong discriminating power, and in sum with maximal coverage. The resulting feature scores are then combined into a single Bright Score using a custom algorithm, where the feature weights are derived from a nation-wide and controlled study in which we collected a large sample of human judgments on real resume-job pairings. We demonstrate that the addition of social media profile data and external data improves the classification accuracy dramatically in terms of identifying the most qualified candidates.</p>

790,790,,,"<p>I don't believe that AI as a coherent field has a lesser legitimacy than, say, Engineering.  Ignoring for the moment that we're a day or two behind on AI, they're very much alike: 
Both fields contain a wide variety of sub-fields which stretch across multiple disciplines (although admittedly more pronounced in AI) , in both fields it is mandatory to specialize and in both of them an expert in one sub-field will be more or less useless in a different one (the expert on bridge construction will probably not be very versed in the thermodynamics of AC systems and vice versa). This pattern can be seen in many of today's disciplines - in fact, I don't know if there still is a reputable field, in which a single person can be a universal expert. </p>

<p>You mentioned that the only unifying thing about AI was it's dealing with machines in some fashion - but such a simplifying statement can be made about almost any field. To return to my previous example: the only unifying thing about the various Engineering activities is that they're all somehow involved in the construction of something (be it a flashlight or an aircraft carrier).</p>

<p>AI is a young field and therefore its branches have not yet been established in the sophisticated way that the branches of other fields have, but I would assume that it is only a matter of time until the various differentiations and the corresponding degrees, courses etc. develop.  </p>

<p>AI is also growing up in a time where vast knowledge in its related/parental fields already exists and further knowledge is produced at dizzying speeds - and that is as much a blessing as it is a curse. When Engineering was 'created' a few millennia ago (please excuse my ridiculously inaccurate science history lessons) there wasn't much going on in the world of science and so the field grew slowly, with plenty of time to get organized and structured. That is a luxury which AI did/does not have. It emerged in an age of technical wonders, surrounded by scientific breakthroughs on at least a monthly basis and the rise of interdisciplinary science (which by itself complicated things quite a bit). So in addition to organizing itself, the field also has to continuously integrate the large number of advancements made and somehow stand its ground against the outlandish expectations generated by other science's breakthroughs over the past decades and the media (as already explained by SQLServerSteve). </p>

<p>Long story short: it's similar in it's complexity and diversity to other fields and therefore has no reason to collapse - on the contrary, its failure to do so over the past ~50 rather complicated years indicates, that it will further solidify and organize itself in the future. </p>

799,799,,,"<p>In regards to the question you mention (in the comments of the OP), these searches are related to optimization. I'm not sure of your background, so let me describe it from scratch, briefly:</p>

<p>Remember the derivative? The base idea is to talk about how the function changes in regards to changes in input. So now, we're out of high school and we're building neural nets. We've done the basic coding, and want to look at how our model is working. Back from our statistics class, we remember we use a certain measure of error (e.g. least squares) to determine the efficacy of the models from that class, so we decide to use that here. We get this error, and it's a bit too big for our liking, so we decide to fiddle with our model and adjust the weights to get that error down. But how? </p>

<p>This is where the 'search' comes into play. It's really a search for the best weights to put on the edges of our net to optimize it. We use the derivative (in some fancy ways, using the 'stochasitc' (think random sampling) and other ways the question mentions) to search for which way is 'down' in the high dimensional space of our weights. In other words, what we are searching for is minima or maxima to optimize our neural net, and we 'search' for it by doing a derivative which tells us which way to go, moving a bit in that direction, then doing that again and again iteratively to find (hopefully) the best weights.</p>

800,800,,,"<p>Search has always been a crucial element of AI in multiple ways.  First, what many people refer to as ""search"" is a reflection of how what we call ""intelligence"" frequently involves searching something:  a physical realm, a ""state space"" of possible solutions, a ""knowledge space"" where ideas/facts/concepts/etc. are related as a graph structure, etc.</p>

<p>Look up some old papers on computer chess, and you'll see that a lot of that involves searching a ""state space"".  As such, search algorithms that are efficient (in terms of time complexity and/or space complexity) have always been important to making advances there.  And while computer chess is just one example, the principle generalizes to many other kinds of problem solving and goal seeking activities.</p>

<p>Here's <a href=""http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/mmg/teaching/artificialintelligence/nonflash/problemframenf.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">a reference</a> that explains more about some of these ideas.</p>

<p>Note too that ""search"" is closely related to the idea of ""heuristics"" in an important way.  Many search problems in the real world are far too complex to solve by exhaustive brute-force search, so humans (and AI's) resort to heuristics to narrow the state space being searched.  Using heuristics can yield search algorithms that allow for reasonable solutions in a realistic time-frame, where no simple, deterministic algorithm exists to do likewise.  </p>

<p>For some more background you might want to read up on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">A* search</a>, which is a widely used algorithm with many applications - and not just in AI.</p>

<p>The other major regard in which something you could call ""search"" applies in AI is through the use of algorithms which are also often referred to as ""optimisation"" techniques.  This would be things like Hill Climbing, Gradient Descent, Simulated Annealing and perhaps even Genetic Algorithms.  These are used to maximize or minimize the values of some function  and one of the canonical uses in AI is for training neural networks using back-propagation, where you're trying to minimize the delta between the ""correct"" answer (from the training data) and the generated answer, so you can learn the correct weights within the network.</p>

801,801,,,"<p>`State space search' is a general and ubiquitous AI activity that includes numerical optimization (e.g. via gradient descent in a real-valued search space) as a special case.</p>

<p>State space search is an abstraction which can be customized for a particular problem via three ingredients:</p>

<ol>
<li>Some representation for candidate solutions to the problem (e.g.
permutation of cities to represent a Travelling Salesman Problem
(TSP) tour, vector of real values for numeric problems).</li>
<li>A
solution quality measure: i.e. some means of deciding which of two
solutions is the better. This is typically achieved (for
single-objective problems) by having via some integer or real-valued
function of a solution (e.g. total distance travelled for a TSP
tour). </li>
<li>Some means of moving around in the space of possible solutions, in a heuristically-informed manner. Derivatives can be used if
available, or else (e.g. for black-box problems or discrete solution
representations) the kind of mutation or crossover methods favoured
by genetic algorithms/evolutionary computation can be employed.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first couple of chapters of the freely available <a href=""https://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/book/metaheuristics/"" rel=""nofollow"">""Essentials of Metaheuristics""</a> give an excellent overview and  Michalewicz and Fogel's <a href=""http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540224945"" rel=""nofollow"">""How to Solve It - Modern Heuristics""</a> explains in more detail how numerical optimization can be considered in terms of state-space.</p>

<p>In response to a request in the comments to explain how  clarify how ""the 'search through possible plans' might occur"", the idea is to choose all three of the above for the planning problem and then apply some metaheuristic such as Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, Genetic Algorithms etc. Clearly, for nontrivial problems, only a small fraction of the space of ""all possible plans"" is actually explored.</p>

<p>CAVEAT: Actually <em>planning</em> (in contrast to the vast majority of other problems amenable to state-space search such as scheduling, packing, routing etc) is a bit of a special case, in that it is sometime possible to solve planning problems simply by using A* search, rather than searching with a stochastic metaheuristic.</p>

<p>My idea would be to start with unmanaged C++ in .net, but use simply, native .exe-s to your final programs.

806,806,,,"<p>I'm not sure about ""emulating the brain"" per-se, but in a more general sense there has been some thought given to using analog computing for AI/ML.  It seems clear that analog computers do have certain advantages over digital computers.  For one, they can (depending on the application) be faster, albeit at the cost of some loss of precision.  But that's OK, because I don't think anybody believes the human brain is calculating floating point math using digital computing techniques either.  The human brain appears, at least superficially, to be largely probabilistic and able to tolerate some ""slop"" numerically.  </p>

<p>The downside to analog computers, as I understand it, is that they're not as flexible... you basically hardwire a circuit to do one specific ""thing"" and that's really all it can do.  To change the ""programming"" you have to literally solder in a new component! Or, I suppose, adjust a potentiometer or adjustable capacitor, etc.  Anyway, the point is that digital computers are supremely flexible, which is one big reason they came to dominate the world.

That is, every problem can be formulated as a kind of map from one space to another, where the source is the givens of the problem, and the destination is the solution to the problem.</p>

<p>""Brute force"" is the algorithm which solves every problem by inspecting every point in the codomain and asking: ""Is this the solution?""  Every other algorithm is an attempt to improve on brute force by not searching the entire codomain of possible solutions.</p>

<p>Typical software engineering problems can be solved by algorithms which arrive at the correct solution very quickly (sorting, arithmetic, partition, etc.).  AI problems are generally those for which a strong polynomial  algorithm is not known, and thus, we must settle for approximations.  Basically every common problem that the human brain must solve falls into this category.</p>

<p>Consider the problem of moving a multi-jointed robotic arm to pick up an object.  Reverse kinematics does not have unique solutions: there is more than one way to move your hand from a start position to a target position.  This is due to the excessive degrees of freedom in your joints.  If you want to minimize energy usage, then there is a unique solution (due to the asymmetry of joints and muscles).</p>

<p>But what if there is an obstacle in the pathway of the minimum-energy solution?  There are many pathways which avoid the obstacle, but again, many of them will have a similar cost.  Even if there is a unique minimum-energy solution, it might not be the most practical to compute.  The brain is the most metabolically expensive organ in the body, so it is not always best to find an optimal solution.  Thus, heuristics come into play.</p>

<p>But in all cases, the problem is not: ""move your hand"" or ""move the robot arm.""  The problem is: ""search the space of joint rotation sequences which best achieves the goal.""  And even though there is a closed-form solution for the simple minimum-energy case with no obstacles, it is too expensive to compute precisely when a set of cheap heuristics will get you very close with a small fraction of the computational effort.</p>

<p>If computation were free, then AI would be mere mathematics, and we would always compute the best answer to every question using logic, calculus, physics, at worst, numerical methods when we don't have closed-form solutions.  In reality, time is money, and the time and effort to get an answer is as much a part of the cost as the quality of the solution.  So it is an engineering tradeoff to decide how much effort should be expended in what way to obtain the best answer given the value of the response.</p>

<p>Or, in other words, AI problems are all about searching the space of solutions as quickly as possible to get an answer that is ""good enough"".</p>

<p>I might seem curious that such far-flung problems as natural language recognition and theorem proving would be search problems.  But language parsers strive to determine the meaning of statements via part-of-speech tagging.  A given phrase can be parsed in many different ways, yielding many different interpretations, and the space of parse trees is yet another search problem in deciding which parse tree is the most likely intended meaning by the speaker.</p>

<p>A theorem proof is graph starting with axioms, proceeding through lemmas, applying the rules of procedure until the theorem is derived or refuted (by proving its negation).  There are many ways to represent this sequence, but at the end of the day, we are talking about a process of exploring the intermediate proof space and finding the derivation which reaches your goal.  Everything is search, in the end.</p>

<p>Why: because it's not possible to formally determine even whether your fellow human beings are actually conscious (they may instead be what is philosophically termed a <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/"" rel=""nofollow"">'Zombie'</a>). No test known to modern physics suffices to decide. Hence it's possible that you are the only sentient being, and everyone else is a robot.</p>

<p>Consequently, we cannot determine which tasks require sentience.</p>

<p>Note that the ontological status of Zombies is controversial: some philosophers of AI (e.g. Daniel Dennett) claim that Zombies are <a href=""https://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/papers/unzombie.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">logically impossible</a> while others such as <a href=""http://consc.net/zombies.html"" rel=""nofollow"">David Chalmers</a> would claim that a Zombie would be compelled to assert that they experience <em>qualia</em> (i.e. are sentient) even though they do not. <a href=""http://homepages.uc.edu/~polgertw/Polger-ZombiesJCS.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Here</a> is a very readable paper by Flanagan and Polger that also explains why a stronger neurological version of the Turing test is insufficient to detect a Zombie.</p>

<p>No-one knows. What we <em>do</em> believe is that this would require something in addition to what modern physics can currently tell us. David Chalmers has speculated that qualia should be introduced as a new form of physical unit, orthogonal to the others in the same way that electrical charge is orthogonal to distance.</p>

<p>Sentience <em>colloquially</em> often translates to 'the ability to reason while understanding that oneself and each other entity is a distinct acting agent'or something along those lines. It literally means something more along the lines of self-awareness and the definition of consciousness you have above.

822,822,,1.0,"<p>I recently finished Course on RL by David Silver (on YT) and thought about trying it out on simple application in Unity Game Engine, where I've built simple labyrint with ball and want to teach the ball to get from point A to point B in there while avoiding obstacles and fire (the place where you'll get burnt so big negative reward)</p>

<p>The problem I encountered while designing the whole thing (programming-wise) is: What is the correct (or at least good) way of representing the position in 2D space? It is continuous so I thought about representing it as feature vector consisting of [up, down, left, right, posX, posY] where direction is whether I am pressing button of moving in that direction in binary (or actions if you want) and pos are floats (0-1) representing normalized position from one corner on the plane where the whole map is. That would be accompanied by vector W that would represent the weights adjusted using Gradient Descent.</p>

<p>Question is: will this work?? I am asking for 2 reasons. One is that I am not so sure about that posX and posY since it can be 0 and if I multiply it by the weights vector then how could be resulting reward anything but 0? Second reason is that I am not sure if the actions should be part of the features. I mean, it makes sense to me but I could easily be very wrong since I am a beginner.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot guys in advance. If you have any more questions or think the problem is not described deeply enough just ask in the comments and I'll edit the question. :)</p>

825,825,,,"<p>Just to add some discourse; this is actually an incredibly complex task, as gestures (aka kinematics) function as an auxiliary language that can completely change the meaning of a sentence or even a single word. I recently did a dissertation on the converse (generating the correct gesture from a specific social context &amp; linguistic cues). The factors that go into the production of a particular gesture include the relationship between the two communicators (especially romantic connotations), the social scenario, the physical context, the linguistic context (the ongoing conversation, if any), a whole lot of personal factors (our gesture use is essentially a hybrid of important individuals around us e.g. friends &amp; family, and this is layered under the individual's psychological state). Then the whole thing is flipped around again when you look at how gestures are used completely differently in different cultures (look up gestures that are swear words in other cultures for an example!). There are a number of models for gesture production but none of them capture the complexity of the topic.</p>

<p>Now, that may seem like a whole lot of fluff that is not wholly relevant to your question, but my point is that ASIMO isn't actually very 'clever' at this. AFAIK (I have heard from a visualization guy that this is how <em>he</em> thinks they do it) they use conventional (but optimized) image recognition techniques trained on a corpus of data to achieve recognition of particular movements. One would assume that the dataset consists of a series of videos / images of gestures labelled with that particular gesture (as interpreted by a human), which can then be treated as a machine learning problem. The issue with this is that it does not capture ANY of the issues I mentioned above. Now if we return to the current best interpretation of gesture that we have (that it is essentially auxiliary language in its own right), ASIMO isn't recognizing any element of language beyond the immediately recognizable type, 'Emblems'.</p>

<p>'Emblems' are gestures which have a direct verbal translation, for example in English-based cultures, forming a circle with your thumb and index finger translates directly to 'OK'. ASIMO is therefore missing out on a huge part of the non-verbal dictionary (illustrators, affect displays, regulators and adapters are not considered!), and even the part that it is accessing is based on particular individuals' interpretations of said emblems (e.g. someone has sat down and said that <em>this</em> particular movement is <em>this</em> gesture which means <em>this</em>), which as we discussed before is highly personal and contextual. I do not mean this in criticism of Honda; truth be told, gesture recognition and production is in my opinion one of the most interesting problems in AI (even if its not the most useful) as it is a compound of incredibly complex NLP, visualization and social modelling problems!</p>

<p>Hopefully I've provided some information on how ASIMO works in this context, but also on why ASIMO's current process is flawed when we look at the wider picture.</p>

828,828,,,"<p>Interesting question.  I don't think anybody knows a definite answer, but some rough-sketch ideas seem apparent.  Think about what it means to you to be ""self aware"".  You'll probably cite the way you ""hear"" your own thoughts in your head when you think about something.  One can speculate that inside the brain, the various centers that are responsible for hearing, vision, logic, etc. are connected so that as you form a thought, it's being ""heard"" by the hearing regions, even though it's purely internal instead of actual sound received at the ear.</p>

<p>So in AI terms, it seems likely that self-awareness will somehow involve taking the ""thoughts"" formed within the AI, and feeding them back into the AI so that it ""hears"" (or, more broadly, ""senses"") itself think.  </p>

829,829,,,"<p>I think your net should have the various actions as outputs, but I am not an expert in Deep Nets. I just think that that light form of multi-task learning might be better. The idea of multi-task learning is that a predictor predicting multiple variables (in this case the various Q(s,a1), Q(s,a2), ...) using mostly the same structure (varying only the output weights) will learn more sensible things. Though I admit applying this here might be a bit of a stretch.</p>

<p>As for the real question, a popular technique in Reinforcement Learning is <a href=""https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/node88.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Tile Coding</a>.</p>

<p>The basic idea is to discretize the (2-dimensional, in your case) state-space - imagine a grid laid over the 2D space - and assigning an input feature to each cell; all of these variables are set to zero except for the one your continuous variables fall into. For example, if your grid is 20x20, you will have 400 variables, 399 of which are set to zero, and 1 set to one.</p>

<p>Tile Coding takes this one step further and repeats this using slight offsets for the grid. Imagine you create an identical grid but you move it slightly to the right by 1/10 of the width of a cell: you will have another set of 400 variables like before, but it is possible that the cell set to one is not the same. Then you repeat this moving the grid by 2/10 and you have another set of 400 variables, again, only 1 of which is set to one. In total you have 10 sets of 400 variables (if you repeat more than that, you get the same grids as before); of your 4000 variables, only 10 are set to one.
Now you repeat this by adding a 1/10 of a cell offset in the Y axis and obtain another 4000 variables. Repeat with 2/10 and you get another 4000. By the end of it, you have 40000 variables, 100 of which are set to one.</p>

<p>Now your net can more easily learn different weights for different positions. I recommend you to follow the link above for a better explanation than mine (and figures!)</p>

<p>My suggestion is to feed all of these variables to your net and have it predict the Q-value for all of the actions. But, again, I am no expert in deep nets so I may be wrong.</p>

<p>Also, according to Andrej Karpathy, ""most people prefer to use Policy Gradients, including the authors of the original DQN paper who have shown Policy Gradients to work better than Q Learning when tuned well."". This means that you may be better off not using Q-learning (as they did in the original DQN formulation) to train your net.

831,831,,,"<h3>Strong AIs</h3>

<p>For a strong AI, the short answer is to call for help, when they might not even know what the supposed help could be.</p>

<p>It depends on what the AI would do. If it is supposed to solve a single easy task perfectly and professionally, sure emotions would not be very useful. But if it is supposed to learn random new things, there would be a point that it encounters something it cannot handle.</p>

<p>In Lee Sedol vs AlphaGo match 4, some pro who has said computer doesn't have emotions previously, commented that maybe AlphaGo has emotions too, and stronger than human. In this case, we know that AlphaGo's crazy behavior isn't caused by some deliberately added things called ""emotions"", but a flaw in the algorithm. But it behaves exactly like it has panicked.</p>

<p>If this happens a lot for an AI. There might be advantages if it could know this itself and think twice if it happens. If AlphaGo could detect the problem and change its strategy, it might play better, or worse. It's not unlikely to play worse if it didn't do any computations for other approaches at all. In case it would play worse, we might say it suffers from having ""emotions"", and this might be the reason some people think having emotions could be a flaw of human beings. But that wouldn't be the true cause of the problem. The true cause is it just doesn't know any approaches to guarantee winning, and the change in strategy is only a try to fix the problem. Commentators thinks there are better ways (which also don't guarantee winning but had more chance), but its algorithm isn't capable to find out in this situation. Even for human, the solution to anything related to emotion is unlikely to remove emotions, but some training to make sure you understand the situation enough to act calmly.</p>

<p>Then someone has to argue about whether this is a kind of emotion or not. We usually don't say small insects have human-like emotions, because we don't understand them and are unwilling to help them. But it's easy to know some of them could panic in desperate situations, just like AlphaGo did. I'd say these reactions are based on the same logic, and they are at least the reason why human-like emotions could be potentially useful. They are just not expressed in human-understandable ways, as they didn't intend to call a human for help.</p>

<p>If they tries to understand their own behavior, or call someone else for help, it might be good to be exactly human-like. Some pets can sense human emotions and express human-understandable emotion to some degree. The purpose is to interact with humans. They evolved to have this ability because they needed it at some point. It's likely a full strong AI would need it too. Also note that, the opposite of having full emotions might be becoming crazy.</p>

<p>It is probably a quick way to lose any trust if someone just implement emotions imitating humans with little understanding right away in the first generations, though.</p>

<h3>Weak AIs</h3>

<p>But is there any purposes for them to have emotions before someone wanted a strong AI? I'd say no, there isn't any inherent reasons that they must have emotions. But inevitably someone will want to implement imitated emotions anyway. Whether ""we"" need them to have emotions is just nonsense.</p>

<p>The fact is even some programs without any intelligence contained some ""emotional"" elements in their user interfaces. They may look unprofessional, but not every task needs professionality so they could be perfectly acceptable. They are just like the emotions in musics and arts. Someone will design their weak AI in this way too. But they are not really the AIs' emotions, but their creators'. If you feel better or worse because of their emotions, you won't treat individul AIs so differently, but this model or brand as a whole.</p>

<p>Alternatively someone could plant some personallities like in a role-playing game there. Again, there isn't a reason they must have that, but inevitably someone will do it, because they obviously had some market when a role-playing game does.</p>

<p>In either cases, the emotions don't really originate from the AI itself. And it would be easy to implement, because a human won't expect them to be exactly like a human, but tries to understand what they intended to mean. It could be much easier to accept these emotions realizing this.</p>

<h3>Aspects of emotions</h3>

<p>Sorry about posting some original research here. I made a list of emotions in 2012 and from which I see 4 aspects of emotions. If they are all implemented, I'd say they are exactly the same emotions as of humans. They don't seem real if only some of them are implemented, but that doesn't mean they are completely wrong.</p>

<ul>
<li>The reason, or the original logical problem that the AI cannot solve. AlphaGo already had the reason, but nothing else. If I have to make an accurate definition, I'd say it's the state that multiple equally important heuristics disagreeing with each other.

<ul>
<li>The context, or which part of the current approach is considered not working well and should probably be replaced. This distinguishes sadness-related, worry-related and passionate-related.</li>
<li>The current state, or whether it feels leading, or whether its belief or the fact is supposed to turn bad first (or was bad all along) if things go wrong. This distinguishes sadness-related, love-related and proud-related.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The plan or request. I suppose some domesticated pets already had this. And I suppose these had some fixed patterns which is not too difficult to have. Even arts can contain them easily. Unlike the reasons, these are not likely inherent in any algorithms, and multiple of them can appear together.

<ul>
<li>Who supposedly had the responsibility if nothing is changed by the emotion. This distinguishes curiosity, rage and sadness.</li>
<li>What is the supposed plan if nothing is changed by the emotion. This distinguishes disappointment, sadness and surprise.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The source. Without context, even a human cannot reliably tell someone is crying for being moved or thankful, or smiling for some kind of embarrassment. In most other cases there aren't even words describing them. It doesn't make that much difference if an AI doesn't distinguish or show this specially. It's likely they would learn these automatically (and inaccurately as a human) at the point they could learn to understand human languages.</li>
<li>The measurements, such as how urgent or important the problem is, or even how likely the emotions are true. I'd say it cannot be implemented in the AI. Humans don't need to respect them even if they are exactly like humans. But humans will learn how to understand an AI if that really matters, even if they are not like humans at all. In fact, I feel that some of the extremely weak emotions (such as thinking something is too stupid and boring that you don't know how to comment) exist almost exclusively in emoticons, where someone intend to show you exactly this emotion, and hardly noticeable in real life or any complex scenerios. I supposed this could also be the case in the beginning for AIs. In the worst case, they are firstly conventionally known as ""emotions"" since emoticons works in these cases, so it's easier to group them together, but very few people seriously think they are, just like the example I gave.</li>
</ul>

<p>So when strong AIs become possible, none of these would be unreachable, though there might be a lot of work to make the connections. So I'd say if there would be the need for strong AIs, they absolutely would have emotions.</p>

832,832,,,"<p>Let's use a simple test based on common sense: how often do you see a human being solve problems requiring the use of reason when they're unconscious? Yes, you can find instances of geniuses like Ramanujan solving complex problem during or after a dream state, but those involve partial consciousness. You don't see guys like Einstein coming up with the theory of relativity while in a coma; the Founding Fathers didn't write the Declaration of Independence while sleep-walking; in fact, you can't even find instances of housewives putting together their shopping list for the week during deep delta-wave sleep. This is predicated on a hard definition of intelligence, requiring the use of reason; no one says, ""That fly is intelligent"" or ""that squirrel is intelligent"" precisely because neither is capable of using reason. This is a very high bar for A.I., but it is the common sense definition used by ordinary people as a matter of practicality, in everyday speech.  Likewise, in practice, everyone assumes consciousness is necessary to the exercise of that kind of intelligence.</p>

<p>Conversely, we can come up with another common-sense based criterion for judging objections to this argument, particularly the solipsist one, based on 3 elements: 1) practicality; 2) the effect the objections have on those who hold them sincerely; and 3) the effect that actions based on those beliefs have on others. <strong>It's going to take me several paragraphs to make this case, but the length is necessary if I want to make the case in a complete, thorough fashion</strong>. It is true that we cannot prove that another human being possesses consciousness, if our standard is absolute proof. We cannot, in fact, provide absolute proof for anything; there's always room for some objection, no matter how ridiculous or trifling. As some philosophers have pointed out, perhaps all of reality as we know it is just a dream, or the product of some long, involved conspiracy like the plot of the Jim Carrey movie The Truman Show. The key to meeting such objections is that they require an infinite regress of increasingly untenable objections, whose likelihood plunges with each additional step required to justify such unreasonable doubts; I've always wondered if we could come up with a ""Ridiculousness Metric"" for Machine Learning based on the cardinality of such objections (or the pickiness of fuzzy sets). If we were to allow critics to stick their foot in the door with all manner of unreasonable objections, it would be impossible to close any debate. The human race would be paralyzed in inaction because nothing would be decidable; but as the rock band Rush once pointed out, ""If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice."" At some point we must apply a test to decide such things, even in the absence of absolute proof; refusal to apply a test also constitutes a choice. Settling an argument of this kind is like a game  of the Chinese game Go - once the other player's surrounded and has no more moves left to make, the game is over; if a person's evidence has debunked and they have no further justifications left, then we can conclude that they're acting unreasonably. There are people running around claiming the Holocaust never happened, or the Flat Earth Society, etc., but their existence shouldn't and doesn't stop us from taking action contrary to their ideas. We can debunk the objections of cranks like the Flat Earth Society beyond a reasonable doubt because in the end, they simply can't answer all of our rebuttals. I’m glad that qualia and Philosophical Zombies were brought up because they make for interesting conversation and food for thought, but solipsism is acted upon as rarely as the ideas of the Flat Earth Society precisely because the incomplete evidence we <strong>do</strong> have runs against it.</p>

<p>As G.K. Chesterton (a.k.a. ""The Apostle of Common Sense"") points out in his classic <a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/130"" rel=""nofollow"">Orthodoxy</a>, radical doubt of the kind many classical philosophers preached is not a path to wisdom but to madness; once we go beyond a reasonable doubt, we end up acting unreasonably. He says that in the absence of absolute proof we can fall back on another secondary form of evidence: whether a person's philosophy leads a man to Hanwell, the infamous British mental institution. Chesterton makes a good case that when people actually act on ideas like solipsism (rather than merely debating them in a pedantic manner in an ivy-covered classroom) they go mad The Philosophical Zombie argument is close to solipsism, which is actually one of the diagnostic criteria for certain forms of schizophrenia. The dehumanization that occurs when radical doubt is applied to qualia is also intimately tied in with sociopathic behavior, Although GKC does not cite his scary example directly, Rene Descartes was himself living proof. He was a brilliant mathematician who is still cheered for doubting all except his own existence, with the famous maxim ""I think, therefore I am."" But Descartes also used to carry a mannequin of his dead sister with him to European cafes, where he could be seen chatting with it. The gist of all this is that we can judge the worth of an idea by how it affects the well-being of the believer, or by how they in turn affect others through ethical choices based on those beliefs. When people actually act on radical doubt of the kind expressed in solipsism and denial of common qualia, it often has a bad effect on them and others they come in contact with.</p>

<p>In a roundabout way, the A.I. community also faces a quite serious risk - perhaps a permanent temptation - towards making the opposite mistake, of ascribing common qualia, consciousness and the like to its Machine Learning products without adequate proof. I recently heard a case made on shockingly bad logical grounds by well-respected academics to the effect that plants possess ""intelligence,"" based on really weak definitions and clear confusion with self-organization. We cannot provide absolute proof that a rock doesn't have intelligence, which amounts to the old problem of disproving a negative. Thankfully, few men actually act on such beliefs at present, because when they do, they end up losing their minds. If we take such arguments seriously, we might see laws passed to protect the kind of Pet Rocks that were popular in the '70s (I'm still upset that mine was stolen LOL). It would be a lot easier, however, to make the same mistake of ascribing consciousness, intelligence and other such qualities to a state-of-the-art machine, because of wishful thinking, hubris, the lofty credentials of the inventors, the influence of science fiction and the modern love affair with technology. In the future, I have little doubt that we'll have Cargo Cult of A.I. - perhaps legally protected like some kind of endangered species, with civil rights, but having no more consciousness, soul or actual intelligence than a rock. Don't quote me on this, but I believe Rod Serling once wrote a story to this effect.</p>

<p>The best way to avoid this fate is to stick to the common sense interpretations and definitions of these things, which we keep backing away from in large part because they set a very high bar for A.I. that we may never be able to surpass in our lifetimes, if ever. Perhaps A.I. isn't even logically possible, at any level of technology; I recall a few proofs that can be interpreted to that effect. Those high but reasonable standards may be increasingly difficult to stick to if Chesterton and colleagues like Hilaire Belloc and Arnold Lunn were correct in their assessment that the use of reason has actually been breaking down in Western civilization, at least as far back as the Enlightenment; Lunn's 1931 book The Flight from Reason is a classic in this regard and has yet to be rebutted.  This historical trend is a broad topic in and of itself - but suffice it to say that the denial of reason and obsession with technology are both directly relevant in obvious ways to the field of A.I. If the Flight from Reason is still under way, then we will be increasingly tempted to resort to feckless, facile objections in order to demote the use of reason and indispensable qualities like consciousness in our definitions of A.I., but come up with increasingly weak criteria for proving it; simultaneously, our technology will continue to improve, thereby boosting the ""Artificial"" side of Artificial Intelligence.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong: if I didn't think we can do some really exciting things with A.I., I wouldn't be here. But most of them can be achieved without ever replicating actual human intelligence, by solving whole classes of tangential problems that are difficult for humans to think about, but which do not require consciousness or the use of reason that marks human intelligence. The image recognition capabilities of convolutional neural nets are one example, for instance; if we want human intelligence, we can always manufacture it through the easiest, most economical and time-tested way, by having babies. Perhaps these tangential forms of A.I. should be enough for us for now. We cannot inject the use of reason into our machines if we do not possess enough of it ourselves to decide whether reason is necessary for A.I., or even to discern what it consists of. We can't engineer or deprecate consciousness for A.I. till we're conscious of its significance. I'd wager, however, that everyone reading this thread and weighing intelligent responses is doing so in a conscious state. That in and of itself ought to answer our question satisfactorily for now.</p>

Continuing under the same assumptions, such AI could be ""loaded"" in main memory, or locked waiting for inputs or outputs to complete.</p>

<p>Note that in these two scenarios, <em>rebirth</em> is possible, and they also subsume that there is an entity that can <em>decide</em> conditions for rebirth, or preventing it completely. Would this entity be an ""admin"", a god, other AIs, or a human is another question, really.</p>

<p>The terms ""death"" and ""rebirth"" here could just be changed for ""imprisoning"", where the dynamic version would be like our human prisons, and the static version would be like SciFi cryogeny. This is a bit of a stretch, but we can see an equivalence, and no good reason to qualify these two scenarios as deaths.</p>

<p>In conclusion, death for AI seems to be an exceptional, singular scenario, so AI cannot die <em>in practice</em>, except if we are wrong on how we think we can make AGIs. AI can however be imprisoned <em>forever</em>.</p>

<p>What is therefore needed is some means of moving the AI into a '<em>mentally constrained</em>' state, so that (as per the <a href=""http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/1404/what-is-meant-by-death-in-this-paper"">'formal AI death'</a> paper) what it can subsequently do is limited, even if escapes from an AI-box or is re-instantiated. </p>

<p>One might imagine that this could be done via a form of two-level dialogue, in which: </p>

<ol>
<li>The AI is supplied with percepts intended to further constrain it
(""explaining the error of it's ways"", if you like).  </li>
<li>Its state snapshot is then examined to try and get some indication of whether it is being appropriately persuaded.</li>

860,860,,,"<p>Although there might not conceptually be any sort of <em>inattentional</em> blindness associated with an AI system, there might be cases of <em>partial</em> blindness. </p>

<p>Inattentional blindness could occur to a person due to either over-exhaustion limiting cognitive abilities or overuse of frequent cognitive patterns. Our mind takes short-cuts to prevent processing of too much information -- more than what the mind thinks is necessary. But this sometimes backfires when the minor anomalies are not seen (or rather, <em>perceived</em>). Another form of this could also occur when events occur as part of the peripheral vision while the person concentrates only on the foveal vision.</p>

861,861,,,"<p>The other answers seem to deal with ""final death""...that is, a ""terminal end"" state where an AI cannot recover from. In other words, the AI is unable to function any further.</p>

<p>But that's not how I'd define death. I'd define death as a process being terminated. It doesn't matter if someone restarts the same process, because the existing process is already dead. The AI may have just made a new copy of itself, but it's just a <em>copy</em>, not the original. Death is just death.</p>

<p>We can call this type of ""death"" a ""temporary death""...where the physical body dies but there is some ""psychological continuity"" (such as the source code that is used to run a program) that continues between the different bodies.</p>

<p>This type of ""temporary death"" has been explored in science fiction. <em>PARANOIA</em> and <em>Eclipse Phase</em> features humans who can quite frequently die, only to later be restored through a ""memory backup"". The humans may be functionally immortal...but the original is still dead, no matter what fates the other copies encounter. CGP Grey also made a video about <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQHBAdShgYI"" rel=""nofollow"">Star Trek teleporters</a>, which works by killing you and then spawning another copy of yourself in another area. Actually, fantasy settings <em>also</em> explores the idea of ""temporary death"" as well, where people can die only to later get revived by a magical spell.</p>

<p>My recommendation is to play through the philosophical game <strong><a href=""http://www.philosophyexperiments.com/stayingalive/Default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Staying Alive</a></strong>, which teaches three different philosophical approaches to life (and when that life terminates):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are basically three kinds of things that could be required for the continued existence of your self. One is bodily continuity, which may actually require only that parts of the body stay in existence (i.e., the brain). Another is psychological continuity, which requires the continuance of your consciousness - by which is meant your thoughts, ideas, memories, plans, beliefs, and so on. The third possibility is the continued existence of some kind of immaterial part of you, which might be called the soul*. Of course, it may be the case that a combination of one or more types of these continuity is required for you to survive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The other answers assumes that life is based on ""psychological continuity"", and looks at what might disrupt this ""continuity"". I assume that life is based on ""bodily continuity"", which is much easier to disrupt - just <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_(command)"" rel=""nofollow"">kill</a> the process...it doesn't matter if a new process respawns...because the original process is still dead. By playing through <strong>""Staying Alive""</strong>, you will be able to work out your own personal definition of life and death. Once you have your own personal definition, then simply apply it to this specific case, either siding with ""psychological continuity"" (the other answers) or ""bodily continuity"" (my own opinion).</p>

<p><sub>*If you assume that life requires a soul, well, it is not clear that AI would have souls. If they don't (and this seems the most reasonable assumption here), then they obviously wouldn't be alive (and you cannot die if you are not alive). If they <em>do</em> have souls though, then the other answers which assume ""psychological continuity"" may still be applicable, as it seems that the existence of a ""soul"" is dependent on ""psychological continuity"".</sub></p>

<p>When we ""focus on our own consciousness,"" like mindcrime said, we recall the same words we just uttered because as we say them they are being stored which we then restore with associated emotional context. The conscious experience is what it is like to utter those words, hear them, feel their emotional context, and then feel an emotional response to that context - and then to repeat that process iteratively many times a second. That's how self-recognition works in humans, I think. And I think animals do the same thing, just without the words - only emotions.</p>

The idea is that, if you follow an applicable chain of rules all the way through to the end, you have a classifier, if you stop before that, you have an indicator of which features of the input give more coarse-grained classifications, which can be seen as a progressively detailed sequence of questions that 'help the classification'.</p>

<p>There are many different kinds of IQ tests including written, visual, and verbal assessments, but the majority of questions are based on abstract-reasoning problems that involve creative thinking and true intelligence.</p>

<p>In other words, the computer would have to exhibit something that does not yet exist&hellip; ""strong AI"".</p>

<p>The intelligent computers of science fiction do not exist. At all. We are not even close.

<h3>&hellip;or possibly ""disqualified"" for cheating.</h3>

<p>Even if we could pre-format the questions in a style and delivery system it understands, what does memorization, attention, or speed mean in the context of a computer? I'm not even sure if a standardized IQ test makes sense in this context. It might be like asking how a computer would do in a spelling bee.</p>

<p>In human terms, we're not <em>allowed</em> to bring along reference materials to look up an answer; but how do you rectify that when reference-lookup is innate to a computer's existence? How do you measure memory when storage is non-volatile? This gets into an existential question about the nature of learning and knowledge vs. just taking a lot of notes.</p>

<p>Still, how do you even <strong><em>teach</em></strong> a computer what is meant by <em>""which animals is least like the other four?""</em> Did the computer really figure out what was being asked out of general intelligence, or is the computer simply designed to parse out IQ-style questions specifically? If you designed something with a foreknowledge of what would likely be asked, the computers of today <em>might</em> simply be able to ""recognize"" it as question-style 496.527b and plug in the variables. </p>

<p>But that's not <em>general intelligence</em> by any definition we use or understand. It's just a specialized, slick interpreter designed to parse out a specific type of standardized question. Ask it a style of question it's is not expecting, and you'll see the computer is exhibiting <strong><em>no</em> innate intelligence</strong> at all. </p>

<p>Well if you really think about it, what is passion? How does that passion comes to be a passion.
One of the main topics you might want to touch here is conditioning and thus motivation.</p>

<p>Think about the following:</p>

<p>I have a passion for programming</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why do I have a passion for programming?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because when I wrote my first program I was positively reinforced by the fact that I completed a program, I was negatively reinforced because I removed my frustration of not completing the program</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How come that I have gone through that programming frustration and
  stick to it even if I was frustrated?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because I wanted to learn programming</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why did I wanted to learn programming?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because I wanted a light on an arduino to turn on (projected reinforcer)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why did I wanted to turn the arduino light on?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I could learn programming and because I though it was cool (classical conditioning association that will later be reinforced, projected reinforcement happened right after the classical conditioning association between turn on a led happened)</p>

<p>This can be done through a neural network, where each association is reinforced through a probability of outcome
For example, I did learn arduino, on purpose because it seemed the easiest way to start coding, so the probability of positive outcome was high</p>

<p>This about an opposite situation
Let's say I do not know calculus, and I barely know elementary algebra, if someone started to teach me about integrals saying that this is the only way to start learning more math, I will not be motivate to do so because since I cannot even conceptualize what an integral can be, it will be really hard for me to understand it thus I will not learn calc</p>

<p>Thus we can also discern that motivation is reinforced in small behaviors</p>

<p>Another more practical and realistic example you might use is</p>

<p>If you trow a rat in a cage, and make him lever-press do you think he is going to? No. Although if you reinforce the behavior of going next to the lever slowly and at the end he will lever press and you then reinforce that behavior he will.</p>

<p>Thus, passion is compartmentalized, and that's what you have to do in your NT and make it mathematically</p>

896,896,,,"<p>Just for the sake of completeness, I'll point out that Recurrent Neural Nets (i.e. neural nets with backwards connections) are frequently used for for Natural Language Processing (NLP). This includes variants like Bidirectional, Jordan and Elman Networks. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a more sophisticated neural net algorithm which can accomplish the same time and sequence-based tasks, but which can leverage standard learning methods like backprop since it doesn't suffer from the ""vanishing gradient problem."" This is because LSTMs have been brilliantly engineered as ""perfect integrators,"" which makes it a lot easier to calculate the error gradients etc. over long periods of time. In contrast, learning with RNNs is still not theoretically well-grounded and is difficult to calculate through existing methods like Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT). In Time Delay Neural Networks (TDNNs), the idea is to add new neurons and connections with each new training example across a stretch of time or training sequence; unfortunately, this places a practical limitation on how many examples you can feed into the net before the size of the network gets out of hand or it starts forgetting, just as with RNNs. LSTMs have much longer memories (especially when augmented with Neural Turing Machines) so that'd be my first choice, assuming I wanted to use neural nets for NLP purposes. My knowledge of the subject is limited though (I'm still trying to learn the ropes) so there may be other important neural net algorithms I'm overlooking...</p>

Keep in mind that we have never built AGIs, so we don't know how long the training process can be, but it would be safe to assume pessimistic estimates.</p>

<p>Contrast that to a ""narrow intelligence"". The narrow AI already knows how to drive a car or play Go. It has been programmed to be very excellent at one specific task. You don't need to worry about training the machine, because it has already been pre-trained.</p>

<p>A ""general intelligence"" seems to be more flexible than a ""narrow intelligence"". You could buy an AGI and have it drive a car <em>and</em> play Go. And if you are willing to do more training, you can even teach it a new trick: <em>how to bake a cake</em>. I don't have to worry about unexpected tasks coming up, since the AGI will <em>eventually</em> figure out how to do it, given enough training time. I would have to wait a <em>long time</em> though.</p>

<p>A ""narrow intelligence"" appears to be <em>more efficient</em> at its assigned task, due to it being programmed specifically for that task.

Instead of buying one AGI to handle a bunch of different tasks poorly, I would rather buy a bunch of specialized narrow AIs.

<p>But recently I have found one theory that introduces a novel interpretation of residual networks showing they are exponential ensembles:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06431"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Residual Networks are Exponential Ensembles of Relatively Shallow Networks (2016)</em></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Deep Resnets are described as many shallow networks whose outputs are pooled at various depths. 
There is a picture in the article. I attach it with explanation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PGhK2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PGhK2.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a> Residual Networks are
  conventionally shown as (a), which is a natural representation of
  Equation (1). When we expand this formulation to Equation (6), we
  obtain an unraveled view of a 3-block residual network (b). From this
  view, it is apparent that residual networks have O(2^n) implicit paths
  connecting input and output and that adding a block doubles the number
  of paths.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In conclusion of the article it is stated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>It is not depth, but the ensemble that makes residual networks strong</strong>.
  Residual networks push the limits of network multiplicity, not network
  depth. Our proposed unraveled view and the lesion study show that
  residual networks are an implicit ensemble of exponentially many
  networks. If most of the paths that contribute gradient are very short
  compared to the overall depth of the network, <strong>increased depth</strong>
  alone <strong>can’t be the key characteristic</strong> of residual networks. We now
  believe that <strong>multiplicity</strong>, the network’s expressability in the
  terms of the number of paths, plays <strong>a key role</strong>.</p>

<p>But it is only a recent theory that can be confirmed or refuted. It happens sometimes that some theories are refuted and articles are withdrawn.</p>

  concepts of implementation that can be discussed freely. The two most
  important of these are how the Zeta 1 algorithm (encapsulated in each
  memory node of the network hierarchy) implements HTM theory. To
  implement any theory in software, an algorithmic design for each
  aspect of the theory must be addressed. The most important design
  decision Numenta adopted was to eliminate feedback within the
  hierarchy and instead choose to simulate this theoretical concept
  using only data pooling algorithms for weighting. This decision is
  immediately suspect and violates key concepts of HTM. Feedback,
  Hawkins’ insists, is vital to cortical function and central to his
  theories. Still, Numenta claims that most HTM applicable problems can
  be solved using their implementation and proprietary pooling
  algorithms.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am still learning the ropes in this field and cannot say whether or not Numenta has since scrapped this approach in favor of a full implementation of Hawkins' ideas, especially the all-important prediction architecture. Even if they have, this design decision has probably delayed adoption by many years. That's not a criticism per se; perhaps the computational costs of tracking prediction values and updating them on the fly were too much to bear at the time, on top of the ordinary costs of processing neural nets, leaving them with no other path except to try half-measures like their proprietary pooling mechanisms. Nevertheless, all of the best research papers I've read on the topic since then have chosen to reimplement the algorithms rather than relying on Numenta's platform, typically because of the missing prediction features. Cases in point include Bonhoff's thesis and <a href=""http://cogprints.org/9187/1/HTM_TR_v1.0.pdf"">Maltoni's technical report for the University of Bologna Biometric System Laboratory</a><a href=""http://cogprints.org/9187/1/HTM_TR_v1.0.pdf"">2</a>. In all of those cases, however, there is no readily accessible software for putting their variant HTMs to immediate use (as far as I know). The gist of all this is that like G.K. Chesterton's famous maxim about Christianity, ""HTMs have not been tried and found wanting; they have been found difficult, and left untried."" Since Numenta left out the prediction steps, I assume that they would be the main stumbling blocks awaiting anyone who wants to code Hawkins' full vision of what an HTM should be.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network"" rel=""nofollow"">RNNs</a> are a very natural NN to chose if you have texts of varying size as input.

<p>One can classify AI decision-making approaches into two types: interpolative thinkers, and extrapolative thinkers. </p>

<p>Interpolative thinkers learn to classify and mimic whatever they're learning from, and don't try to give reasonable results outside of their training domain. You can think of them as interpolating between training examples, and benefitting from all of the mathematical guarantees and provisos as other statistical techniques.</p>

<p>Extrapolative thinkers learn to manipulate underlying principles, which allows them to combine those principles in previously unconsidered ways. The relevant field for intuition here is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization"">numerical optimization</a>, of which the simplest and most famous example is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming"">linear programming</a>, rather than the statistical fields that birthed machine learning. You can think of them as extrapolating beyond training examples (indeed, many of them don't even require training examples, or use those examples to infer underlying principles).</p>

<p>The promise of extrapolative thinkers is that they can come up with these 'lateral' solutions much more quickly than people would be able to. The problem with these extrapolative thinkers is that they only use the spoken principles, not any unspoken ones that might seem too obvious to mention.</p>

<p>An attribute of solutions to optimization problems is that the feature vector is often 'extreme' in some way. In linear programming, at least one vertex of the feasible solution space will be optimal, and so simple solution methods find an optimal vertex (which is almost infeasible by nature of being a vertex).</p>

<p>As another example, the minimum-fuel solution for moving a spacecraft from one position to another is called '<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang%E2%80%93bang_control"">bang-bang</a>,' where you accelerate the craft as quickly as possible at the beginning and end of the trajectory, coasting at maximum speed in between.</p>

<p>While a virtue when the system is correctly understood (bang-bang <em>is</em> optimal for many cases), this is catastrophic when the system is incorrectly understood. My favorite example here is <a href=""https://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/d1/teaching/ws14/Ideen-der-Informatik/Dantzig-Diet.pdf"">Dantzig's diet problem</a> (discussion starts on page 5 of the pdf), where he tries to optimize his diet using math. Under his first constraint set, he's supposed to drink 500 gallons of vinegar a day. Under his second, 200 bouillon cubes. Under his third, two pounds of bran. The considerations that make those obviously bad ideas aren't baked into the system, and so the system innocently suggests them.</p>

<p>If you can completely encode the knowledge and values that a person uses to judge these plans into the AI, then extrapolative systems are as safe as that person. They'll be able to consider and reject the wrong sort of extreme plans, and leave you with the right sort of extreme plans.</p>

<p>But if you can't, then it does make sense to not build an extrapolative decision-maker, and instead build an interpolative one. That is, instead of asking itself ""how do I best accomplish goal X?"" it's asking itself ""what would a person do in this situation?"". The latter might be much worse at accomplishing goal X, but it has much less of the tail risk of sacrificing other goals to accomplish X.</p>

<hr>

<p>feel free to skip the problem explanation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A friend is writing a path-finding algorithm - an autopilot for an
  (off-road) vehicle in a computer game. This is a pretty classic
  problem - he finds a viable, not necessarily optimal but ""good enough""
  route using the A* algorithm, by taking the terrain layout and vehicle
  capabilities into account, and modifying a direct (straight) line path
  to account for these. The whole map is known a'priori and invariant,
  though the start and destination are arbitrary (user-chosen) and the
  path is not guaranteed to exist at all.</p>
  
  <p>This cookie-cutter approach comes with a twist: limited storage space.
  We can afford some more volatile memory on start, but we should free
  most of it once the route has been found. The travel may take days -
  of real time too, so the path must be saved to disk, and the space in
  the save file for custom data like this is severely limited. Too
  limited to save all the waypoints - even after culling trivial
  solution waypoints ('continue straight ahead'), and by a rather large
  margin, order of 20% the size of our data set.</p>
  
  <p>A solution we came up with is to calculate the route once on start,
  then 'forget' all the trivial and 90% of the non-trivial waypoints.
  This both serves as a proof that a solution exists, and provides a set
  of points reaching which, in sequence, guarantees the route will take
  us to the destination.</p>
  
  <p>Once the vehicle reaches a waypoint, the route to the next one is
  calculated again, from scratch. It's known to exist and be correct
  (because we did it once, and it was correct), it doesn't put too much
  strain on the CPU and the memory (it's only about 10% the total route
  length) and it doesn't need to go into permanent storage (restarting
  from any point along the path is just a subset of the solution
  connecting two saved waypoints).</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Now for the actual question:</p>

<p>The pathfinding algorithm follows a sparse set of waypoints which by themselves are not nearly sufficient as a route, but allow for easy, efficient  calculation of the actual route, simultaneously guarantying its existence; they are a subset of the full solution. </p>

<p>There's no such thing as an AGI. The No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem states essentially that: <em>any two optimization algorithms are equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible problems.</em> Specialization implies a <em>loss</em> of generality, not a <em>gain</em>.</p>

<p>With this AI generating AI, you're describing what I call an 'arbitrary machine generator' (AMG).</p>

<p>There are two types of AMGs: a species level and an individual level.</p>

<p>All species that evolve on earth are AMG - they can evolve to accommodate arbitrary niches, if the correct environmental constraints are present. This is proven by the fact that the species AMG processes on earth have produce humans, which are individual level AMGs. Individual level AMGs can produce arbitrary machines for arbitrary purposes on human time-scales.</p>

<p>The problem is that the simplest possible (and most general) AMG is a purely <em>random</em> machine generator. Any more specificity (and therefore complexity) to the AMG would constrain the domains it closes over. Which is fine, but optimizing a machine for a particular set of tasks means that you are <em>unoptimizing</em> the machine for some other particular set of tasks. Again, there's no free context.</p>

<p>Humans are AMGs, but we are only efficient at creating certain kinds of machines, using our imagination. Our imagination is built on a number of cognitive tools that, on the one hand, constrain what machines we can efficiently imagine, while, on the other hand, avail us to the open-ended set of all possible machines, via prior knowledge or brute force, random lookup.</p>

<p>In summary, when people say <em>""general intelligence""</em>, they really mean <em>""human-like intelligence""</em>. And, again, while human intelligence <em>is</em> an AMG, any given AMG that is optimized for generating machines of a particular type will be less optimized for generating machines of some other type(s). There's no free context. The most general search algorithm is a random walk - there is no way to <em>improve</em> the generality of the random walk, other than just speeding it up. And that's actually what humans do for many problems anyway - brute force, random searching, as fast as possible.</p>

<hr>

<p>Some additional comments about Doxosphoi's answer:</p>

<p>Doxosophoi made some arguments for why current society might not accept the automation of all jobs (the need for the ""personal touch"" that only a human-like intelligence can provide), but that's no reason to assume that society will <em>never</em> accept automation. Technology can change and adapt, and humans can also change and adapt. Maybe a human might not care about a shrink who ""rubs its eyes in the morning"", dislike movies that are marred by that ""vagaries of humanity"" instead of personal customization, prefer politicians and soldiers that actually acts logically instead of acting like a falliable human, etc., etc. I mean, it's <em>possible</em>.</p>

<p>There's also the problem of the term ""job"". Technically, I am working by writing an answer on a StackExchange website, but I'm not getting paid for it, so it's not a real ""job""...at best, it's just a hobby. I'm providing a valuable human touch, but since no one is giving me money, it's possible that this human touch may not be all that valuable in the first place: ""never give out your labor for free, because then they'll take it for free"".</p>

<p>Some of the techno-utopists (which I disagree with heavily) believes in a future where bots handle produce a lot of industrial goods and services, generating a lot of revenue that is then redistributed to the general population via some ""Basic Income"" scheme. This allows humans to do what they really want instead...such as hobbies? And what if the hobbies of the future are the ""jobs"" of today: shrinks, movie directors, politicians, soldiers, etc., etc. Instead of working for a paycheck, you're working in these jobs on a volunteer basis.</p>

<p>Obviously, no automation is being necessary to eliminate these hobbyists (no matter how good a bot is, <em>free labor</em> will always prevail), but they're not really jobs, are they? The bot is the one that is producing real value, and subsidizing the hobbies of all these other people. The idea of a ""job"" itself could be in jeopardy.</p>

<p>I don't think this scenario is likely either (in fact, I'd probably think it's just AI snake oil that will never actually happen). But it's <em>possible</em> and that's why I can't dismiss it outright. It could happen, just that I don't think it will.</p>

<p>It seems they're separating information from knowledge by splitting how from what. What is a superset of how, as far as I'm concerned. It's also a superset of why.</p>

<p>But from an evolutionary perspective, knowledge representation starts with why. Prior to a reason for knowledge representation, there is no knowledge representation. The 'what' existed, but it was not represented until autopoiesis created goal directed, why-oriented behaviors that began storing the what as knowledge. </p>

<p>What is a superset of why, just as ontology is a superset of teleology. However, all <em>represented</em> ontology was acquired through teleological (end-directed) action.</p>

<p>So I disagree with the notion that wisdom, as a why thing, is at the tip of the pyramid. It all started with goal directed behavior and that has been the source of all subsequent information growth.</p>

<p>So what is wisdom? I think it is too much of a folk term to warrant a technical definition.

954,954,,,"<p>As with another answer, I am also skeptical of the distinctions made in the DIKW pyramid.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, a very popular machine learning approach for answering 'Why?' questions is the application of Bayesian reasoning: given a causal data model, reverse inference can be used to find the probability distribution of events which lead to a given outcome.</p>

<p>It could be argued that defining 'cause' in terms of distributions rather than specific concrete mechanisms is a rather limited notion of 'Why?'.</p>

<p>However, it may be that there are some forms of causality that we don't know how to represent, specifically 'first-hand experience'. Indeed, common usage of the term 'wisdom' generally refers to first-hand experience, rather than information gained from some other source. </p>

<p>The idea is that knowledge can be expressed declaratively, whereas wisdom must be derived from experience.</p>

<p>For an AI represented as a computer program, the distinction between declarative and first-hand experience might appear irrelevant, since in principle any experience can be encoded and made available without the program having to 'experience' it first-hand.</p>

<p>However, the following humorous definition of `wisdom' might perhaps shed some light on a distinction that's pertinent to AI research:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Knowledge is knowing that a tomato is a fruit.</p>
  
  <p>Wisdom is knowing that you shouldn't eat it with custard.</p>

<p>This notion of 'Wisdom' could be said to require <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia"" rel=""nofollow"">qualia</a>. It is the subject of much debate whether qualia exist and/or are necessary for consciousness - see for example the thought experiment of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_argument"" rel=""nofollow"">'The Black and White Room'</a>.</p>

<p>So the notion is that there is a distinction between having a Bayesian network representation of wisdom that says: ""It is 99.7% likely that putting a tomato in custard is undesirable"" and the first-hand experience to the effect that it tastes odd with custard.</p>

<p>v. Discrete environment</p>

  <p>The AI effect occurs when onlookers discount the behavior of an artificial intelligence program by arguing that it is not real intelligence.</p>
  
  <p>Pamela McCorduck writes: ""It's part of the history of the field of artificial intelligence that every time somebody figured out how to make a computer do something—play good checkers, solve simple but relatively informal problems—there was chorus of critics to say, 'that's not thinking'.""[1] AI researcher Rodney Brooks complains ""Every time we figure out a piece of it, it stops being magical; we say, 'Oh, that's just a computation.'""[2]</p>

<p>The Wikipedia page then proposes several different reasons that could explain why onlookers might ""discount"" AI programs. However, those reasons seem to imply that the humans are making a mistake in ""discounting"" the behavior of AI programs...and that these AI programs might actually be  intelligent. I want to make an alternate argument, where the humans are making a mistake, but not in ""discounting"" the behavior of AI programs.</p>

<p>Consider the following situation. I want to build a machine that can do X (where X is some trait, like intelligence). I am able to evaluate intuitively whether a machine has that X criteria. But I don't have a good definition of what X actually <em>is</em>. All I can do is identify whether something has X or not.</p>

<p>However, I think that people who has X can do Y. So if I build a machine that can do Y, then surely, I built a machine that has X.</p>

<p>After building the machine that can do Y, I examine it to see if my machine has X. And it does not. So my machine lacks X. And while a machine that can do Y is cool, what I really want is a machine that has X. I go back to the drawing board and think of a new idea to reach X.</p>

<p>After writing on the whiteboard for a couple of hours, I realize that people who has X can do Z. Of course! I try to build a new machine that can do Z, yes, if it can do Z, then it must have X.</p>

<p>After building the machine that can do Z, I check to see if it has X. It does not. And so I return back to the drawing board, and the cycle repeats and repeats...</p>

<p>Essentially, humans are attempting to determine whether an entity has intelligence via proxy measurements, but those proxy measurements are potentially faulty (as it is possible to meet those proxy measurements without ever actually having intelligence). Until we know how to define intelligence and design a test that can accurately measure it, it is very unlikely for us to build a machine that has intelligence. So the AI Effect occurs because humans don't know how to define ""intelligence"", not due to people dismissing programs as not being ""intelligent"".</p>

<p>But when someone says, ""No, X is not <em>real</em> intelligence,"" what they mean is that it does not satisfy what we would consider real <em>human intelligence</em>.</p>

<p>To make a machine do more right than wrong, relative to human goals, one should minimize the surface area of the machine's purpose. Doing that minimizes the intrinsic behavior of the AI, which enables us to reason about the right and wrong behaviors of the AI, relative to human purposes.</p>

<p>Horses are quite general over the domains of their purposes, but are still predictable enough for humans to control and benefit from. As such, we will be able to produce machines (conscious or unconscious) that are highly general over particular domains, while still being predictable enough to be useful to humans.</p>

<p>The most efficient machines for most tasks, though, will not <em>need</em> consciousness, nor even the needs that cause survivalistic, adversarial and self-preserving behaviors in eukaryotic cells. Because most of our solutions won't <em>need</em> those purposes to optimize over our problems, we can allow them to be much more predictable.</p>

<p>We will be able to create predictable, efficient AIs over large domains that are able to produce predictable, efficient AIs over more specific domains. We'll be able to reason about the behavioral guarantees and failure modes of those narrow domains.</p>

<p>In the event that we one day desire to build something as unpredictable as a human, like we do when having babies, then we'll probably do that with the similar intentions and care that we use to bring an actual baby into the world. There is simply no purpose in creating a thing more unpredictable than you unless you're gambling on this thing <em>succeeding</em> you in capability - which sounds exactly like having babies.</p>

<p>After that, the best we can do is give it our <em>theories</em> about why we think we should act one way or another.</p>

<p>Now, theoretically, some extremely powerful AI could potentially construct a human-like simulacrum that, in many common situations, seems to act like a human, but that in fact has had all of it's behaviors formally specified a priori, via some developmental simulation, such that we <em>know for a fact</em> that all such behaviors produce no intentional malice or harm. However, if we can formally specify all such behaviors, we wouldn't be using this thing to solve any novel problems, like curing cancer, as the formal specification for curing cancer would already have been pre-computed. If you can formally specify the behaviors of a thing that can discover something new, you can just compute the solution via the specification, without instantiating the behaviors at all!</p>

  describe a complete workflow and framework for easily designing,
  generating and incorporating multiple, interesting game AIs. Our
  approach uses high-level, visual Statechart models to represent
  behaviour in a modular form; this allows for not only simplistic,
  parameterbased variation in AI design, but also permits more complex
  structure-based approaches. We demonstrate our technique by applying
  it to the task of generating a large number of individual AIs for
  computer-controlled squirrels within the Mammoth <a href=""http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~cdrage/papers/SOCS-TR-2011.1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">1</a> framework for

the presence of mutation makes a GA into a global search algorithm, i.e. it will eventually visit each point in the search space. </p>

<p>TL;DR: The Lovelace Test 2.0 is very vague, making it ill-suited for  evaluation of intelligence. It is also generally ignored by researchers of Computational Creativity, who already have their own tests to evaluate creativity.</p>

<p>Longer Answer:
According to Google Scholar, there are 10 references to the ""Lovelace Test 2.0"" paper. All of those references exist merely to point out that the Lovelace Test 2.0 exists. In fact, at least two of articles I consulted (<a href=""http://philpapers.org/archive/NEGANA.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">A novel approach for identifying a human-like self-conscious behavior</a> and <a href=""http://users.dsic.upv.es/~flip/EGPAI2016/papers/EGPAI_2016_paper_8.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">FraMoTEC: A Framework for Modular Task-Environment Construction for Evaluating Adaptive Control Systems</a>) proposed their <em>own</em> tests instead.</p>

<p>One of the authors who wrote the FraMoTEC paper also wrote <a href=""http://skemman.is/stream/get/1946/25590/58121/1/scs-thorarensen2016-thesis.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">his thesis on FraMoTEC</a>, and indirectly critiqued the Lovelace Test 2.0 and other similar such tests:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Piaget-MacGyver Room problem [Bringsjord and Licato, 2012], Lovelace Test 2.0 [Riedl, 2014] and Toy Box problem [Johnston, 2010] all come with the caveat of being defined very vaguely — these evaluation methods may be likely to come up with a reasonable evaluation for intelligence, but it is very difficult to compare two different agents (or controllers) that partake in the their own domain-specific evaluations, which is what frequently happens when agents are tailored to pass specific evaluations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another major issue with the Lovelace Test 2.0 is that there is a proliferation of <em>other</em> tests to ""measure"" the creativity of AI. <a href=""https://kar.kent.ac.uk/42374/1/jordanous-2011a.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Evaluating Evaluation: Assessing Progress in Computational Creativity Research</a>, published by 
Anna Jordanous in 2011 (3 years <em>before</em> the invention of the Lovelace Test 2.0) analyzed research papers about AI creativity and wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of the 18 papers that applied creativity evaluation methodologies to evaluate their system’s creativity, no one methodology emerged as standard across the community. Colton’s creative tripod framework (<a href=""https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fd8b/d5bb76c94c4bfc34cb1fa244dc6bd4a8ca8e.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Colton 2008</a>) was used most often (6 uses), with 4 papers using Ritchie’s empirical criteria (<a href=""https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/06d8/3be9078b5c8933c3523f0e663fff1c61e3a0.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Ritchie 2007</a>). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That leaves <em>10</em> papers with miscellaneous creativity evaluation methods.</p>

<p>The goal of ""Evaluating Evaluation"" was to standardize the process of evaluating creativity, to avoid the possibility of the field stagnating due to the proliferation of so many creativity tests.  Anna Jordanous still remained interested in evaluating creativity tests, publishing articles such as <a href=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/34328583/Stepping_Back_to_Progress_Forwards-_Setting_Standards_for_Meta-Evaluation_of_Computational_Creativity.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1475893195&amp;Signature=ox0%2FOEkNUNjz5pQg0w%2FOgzHPCsM%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DStepping_Back_to_Progress_Forwards_Setti.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">""Stepping Back to Progress Forwards: Setting Standards for Meta-Evaluation of Computational Creativity""</a> and <a href=""http://doc.gold.ac.uk/~map01mm/CC2015/AISB-CC2015-Proceedings.pdf#page=18"" rel=""nofollow"">Four PPPPerspectives on Computational Creativity</a>.</p>

<p>""Evaluating Evaluation"" does provide some commentary to explain the proliferation of systems to evaluate creativity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Evaluation standards are not easy to define. It is difficult to evaluate creativity and even more difficult to describe how we evaluate creativity, in human creativity as well as in computational creativity. In fact, even the very definition of creativity is problematic (Plucker, Beghetto, and Dow 2004). It is hard to identify what ’being creative’ entails, so there are no benchmarks or ground truths to measure against.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that so many tests of creativity already exist (to the extent that Jordanous can make an academic career in studying them) means that it's very difficult for any new test (such as the Lovelace Test 2.0) to even be noticed (much less cited). Why would you want to use something like the Lovelace Test 2.0 when there's so many other tests you could use instead?</p>

<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence exhibited by machines. In computer science. Colloquially, the term ""artificial intelligence"" is applied when a machine mimics ""cognitive"" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as ""learning"" and ""problem solving"".</p>

<p><strong>Can it be useful in a ""Standard"" application?</strong></p>

<p>Well, what I think about a Standard application using AI is that AI is used for that too, because when the machine have a reaction of the user input is AI or Artificial Intelligence. So the AI in Standard application it have been used many years ago already.</p>

<p>Where people draw the boundaries around 'artificial intelligence' is fuzzy, but if one takes the broad view, where it incorporates any sort of coding of explicitly cognitive functions, then many routine economic tasks can benefit from artificial intelligence. Many search engines, for example, can be seen as offering artificial intelligence applications as a service.</p>

<p>For more 'standard' applications, most near-team applications of AI have to deal with fraud detection and prevention. If you track a user's cursor moving across the screen, for example, you can build a model that differentiates between humans and bots, and treat the two separately. See <a href=""https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/12/05/i-am-not-a-robot-google-swaps-text-captchas-for-quivery-mouse-clicks/"">this article</a> for an example.</p>

(Some are smarter than others. <a href=""https://xkcd.com/1068/"">Relevant XKCD.</a>) It can be used to personalize automatic spelling correction as well.</p>

<p>A potential application interesting to me personally is tile-based level editors, like for classic DOS games. I've been <a href=""https://fleexlab.blogspot.com/search/label/markeen"">working on a program</a> that gathers the probabilities of each tile being close to every other tile and uses that information to construct random new levels. It hasn't produced anything playable yet, but I think it has the potential to assist human level builders by e.g. automatically filling in the missing tile that fits in a newly placed structure, as opposed to requiring the human to go find the right one in the palette.</p>

<p><strong>Under computational Biology :</strong></p>

<p>let me just give you my small knowledge about it.Am a graduate and my area of specialization is in software engineering,currently working on my final year project and doing research focusing on developing machine learning algorithm that will enable the use of an individual’s comprehensive biological information to predict or diagnose diseases, and to find or develop the best therapy for that individual.</p>

<p>If it has recently become possible to retrieve molecular-level information from an individual, such as DNA sequence, gene expression levels in various tissues, epigenomic profile and other information done by big scientists from big medical facility . While such data is increasingly available, Am still unable to understand the genetic and molecular mechanisms that cause diseases. The challenge is due to the multifactorial nature of disease. The same disease can be caused by mutations in different genes or different pathogenic pathways. Unfortunately, current data analysis approaches fail to capture the complex relationship between disease and the vast amount of information in the molecular data.</p>

<p>The aim of my research is to resolve this challenge with other professional researchers by developing machine learning algorithms that jointly model sophisticated interactions among many variables such as genetic variation, genes, pathways and disease, and robustly learn from vast amounts of data in order to better understand and treat disease. An approach that can robustly infer the pathways that can define disease processes will dramatically improve our understanding of diseases and advance personalized medicine in its treatment. We aim to realize this goal by using modern, advanced machine learning techniques that are based on Artificial  Intelligence.</p>

The definition of life in biological terms is the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic matter where the distinguishing criteria are the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change preceding death. Does artificial intelligence ""grow""?  Indeed, I can program a machine learning program to grow with every input taken in.  In the loosest sense, we can say that artificial intelligence does grow, but does it biologically? If we look at the definition for growth of a living thing, it means to undergo natural development by increasing in size and changing physically or the progress to maturity.  All living organisms undergo growth.   Even though at the simplest level, cells are a series of chemical processes, cells are a very complicated set of chemical processes that are still not fully understood by scientists across the world.  Every cell has genetic material that can be replicated, excised, used for RNA, proteins, and that is subject to epigenetic regulation. 
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nczDU.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nczDU.png"" alt=""Cell division""></a></p>

<p>Does artificial intelligence undergo the same process of cell division?  No.  If I wanted to, I could write a program that undergoes a simple for-loop (print i from 1 to 100), replicates itself at a certain point (i=50) to produce the same program perhaps with some variation that will execute itself, and terminates (dies) at the end of the for loop.  The program, by an extremely loose definition supported by philosophy but not by biology, lives.  However, in scientific terms (and the correct interpretation), artificial intelligence is not living.  Artificial intelligence can be seen to be similar to viruses which are considered to be acellular and essential to life but not living.  Viruses are encapsulated DNA and RNA that undergo processes of growth, reproduction, and functionality but because they lack the ability to undergo the cell division cycle, are considered non-living.  At the very basis of the scientific definition of life is the cell replication cycle.  Artificial intelligence and viruses are not able to undergo the cell cycle.  Viruses need to infect other cells in order to reproduce but do not have their own, autonomous cycle.  At the end of the day, if you can argue that viruses are alive, you can argue that artificial intelligence is alive as well.  For the scientific definition of life, artificial intelligence must undergo the process of cell division and replication.  Even though artificial intelligence can mimic and help sustain life, no artificial intelligence process is truly alive. </p>

<p>The lowest levels are extremely simple and common, such are an artificial chess opponent. They work well because the programs internal model of reality is a 8x8 grid with only a few rules. The program chooses a preferred action by running simulations in it's internal model of reality.</p>

<p>What is often meant by AI is a ""General Intelligence"" that can come up with a creative solution to any directive, based on it's internal comprehension of the world. There is no existing example of this as of yet. The problem is that its internal model of reality needs to provide for every possible action. And it's possible actions and reactions may not be limited to a finite number of discretely distinct moves as in a game of chess. (At least if it works on the basis of conventional programming) Even ignoring the computational power needed to run such a broad and inefficient program, it would also require some stupendous amount of labour to program this internal model of reality in the first place.</p>

<p>I think in Sci-Fi, when people say AI, they mean a computer program that has a kind of awareness of itself and the world around it and can come up with creative and unexpected courses of actions in order to achieve its objective. Often the AI is NOT sentient, which is why it does not understand that its actions are morally wrong, or that its solution defeats the underlying intention of its assigned directive.

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Side Note:</strong> An interesting and helpful part of finishing breaking it down, was that I did not have to worry about breaking down spoken language intelligence, as that is already well-successfully accomplished and there are APIs out there in which computational creativity researchers can use such as <a href=""https://wit.ai/"" rel=""nofollow"">wit.ai</a></p>
  
  <p>So, we <em>only</em> have to worry about breaking down the creativity aspect.</p>

<h1>Breaking it Down:</h1>

<h3>The Design Process:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Side Note:</strong> This I could easily provide a citation for, however it has too many accepted descriptions for me to be willing to cite one and to say that it is <em>the</em> or <em>a correct citation</em>. However, I will be providing one as a reference and that is the one provided very nicely on <a href=""https://www.discoverdesign.org/handbook"" rel=""nofollow"">DiscoverDesign</a>.</p>
  
  <p>The paragraph below is provided by them, and if you are interested in breaking that process down more, DiscoverDesign fully explains the processes in detail for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The steps are <em>Define the Problem</em>, <em>Collect Information</em>, <em>Brainstorm and Analyze Ideas</em>, <em>Develop Solutions</em>, <em>Get Some Sort of Feedback</em>, <em>Improve</em> (which is essentially restart the process)</p>

<h3>Defining a problem:</h3>

<p>As far as this part of the breakdown goes, there two algorithms in which you can use for this subprocess of design:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Easy Algorithm (not really an algorithm):</em> ask from the client what the Artificial Intelligence is providing a solution for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, this process could easily be made more interesting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Difficult Algorithm</em>: design an algorithm that can define <em>a problem</em> without user input.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did some digging, and the design of the latter relies on one question that lacks enough research for a <strong>solid</strong> answer, and that is <em>where do questions come from psychologically</em>? or <em>more specifically, how does curiosity work</em>?</p>

<p>With more research on Google I was led to <a href=""http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/evolution/curiosity1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a> specifically addressing that question.</p>

<h3>How Curiosity works:</h3>

<p>The 2 theories it stated that have yet to be fully proven are <em>drive theory</em> and <em>incongruity theory</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Drive Theory simply states, we have a <em>need</em> to be curious, and to fulfill that need, we ask questions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, needless to say this theory isn't helpful to the design of the A.I.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Incongruity Theory</em> states that we are able identify things we <em>do not FULLY understand or understand AT ALL</em> which leads us to asking questions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With help of my peers contributing to my research project, I was able to induce from Incongruity Theory and observations I had noticed within interviews (not job interviews, press interviews) that questions are made by noticing a <em>missing/unclear attribute or characteristic</em> on a certain idea, concept, or object (essentially anything the brain can virtually image or understand).</p>

<h3>My Own Inductive Theory on Curiousity</h3>

<p>The way that I theorize that these missing/unclear attributes are identified is that your consciousness instantaneously, and subconsciously is looking at <em>other similar ideas</em> and looking at <em>their <strong>clear</strong> and <strong>concisely known</strong> attributes</em></p>

<h3>Solution Based on the Theory:</h3>

<p>So, what I have designed is fairly simple:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>An idea</em></strong> is <em>represented programmatically as an <strong>object</strong></em>.</p>
  
  <p><em>The object</em> has certain characteristics known as <em>properties</em> (which are those attributes).</p>
  
  <p>The program reads over those properties and finds other objects <em>similar</em> to it based on those properties.</p>
  
  <p>It then checks those similar objects for properties that the original object <em>does not have</em>, and therefore marks those properties as unknown on the original object, making it possible to apply <em>incongruity theory</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Collecting Information:</h3>

<p>This process is already achieved with <em>machine learning</em>, any questions on this subprocess of design need to be addressed to the <a href=""http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/machine-learning"">machine-learning tag</a></p>

<h3>Brainstorming Ideas:</h3>

<p>This could be accomplished by mixing an algorithm that collects information (collects already working solutions) with the algorithm that I described within the curiosity section</p>

<h3>Analyzing Ideas:</h3>

<p>This is a really simple one. Debugging (not getting input), and getting user feedback (getting input). To provide analyzation over simply an idea you could combine my algorithm, with another information collecting algorithm to <em>induce</em> whether an idea is feasible.</p>

<h3>Developing Solutions:</h3>

<p>This is where IDE-development knowledge comes in handy.</p>

<p><em>In order to make product development</em> <strong><em>easy and understandable</em></strong> <em>to an AI</em>, we have to choose a type of product that could be developed <strong>easily</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Editor's Note:</em> I do recommend this in order to keep the testing of the algorithms for the previous processes really simple.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Easily Designed Product that I Selected for Designing an Algorithm:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am providing this to you, so you can model a way to reproduce this process for the Intelligence you would like to build. So, I only hope that you do not intend on copying it, but my artificial intelligence project is free and open-source, so there is no issue, if you do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Considering that written programs are very easy products to develop fully, and Considering that program language rules are straight forward. and <em>very consistent</em> in comparison to spoken/written languages, I chose to have it develop <em>programs</em>.</p>

<p>So, in order to do this it has to understand how to write a program. The most essential skill a computer programmer can have and needs to write a program is not a <em>dictionary of programming terms, functions, and commands</em>, but rather <em>knowledge of the syntactical rules</em> for a programming language.</p>

<p>The technological solution to this is pretty much already available in IDE tech, and it is known as <em>syntactical highlighting</em>. All that would have to be done is to re-purpose it from <em>highlighting</em> to <em>assisting with writing</em>.</p>

<h3>Getting Some Sort of Feedback.</h3>

<p>This is essentially the same as analyzing the ideas, but now we would be using algorithms to analyze the final physical product as opposed to conceptual ideas.</p>

1024,1024,,,"<p>Can't comment(due to that required 50 rep), but I wanted to make a response to Vishnu JK and the OP. I think you guys are skipping the fact that the neural network only really is saying truly from a programmatic standpoint that ""this is most like"".</p>

<p>For example, while we can list the above image examples as ""abstract art"", they definitively are most like was is listed. Remember learning algorithms have a scope on what they recognize as an object and if you look at all the above examples... and think about the scope of the algorithum... these make sense (even the ones at a glance we would recognize as white noise). In Vishnu example of the numbers, if you fuzz your eyes and bring the images out of focus, you can actually in every case spot patterns that really closely reflect the numbers in question.</p>

<p>The problem that is being shown here is that the algorithm appears to not have a ""unknown case"". Basically when the pattern recognition says that it doesn't exist in the output scope. (so a final output node group that says this is nothing that I know off). For example, people do this as well, as it's one thing humans and learning algorithms have in common. Here's a link to show what I'm talking about (what is the following, define it) using only known animals that exist:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AZwnpm.jpg"" alt=""Picture link""></p>

<p>Now as a person, limited by what I know and can say, I'd have to conclude that the following is an elephant. But it's not. Learning algorithms (for the most part) do not have a ""like a"" statement, the out put always validates down to a confidence percentage. So tricking one in this fashion is not surprising... what is of course surprising is that based on it's knowledge set, it actually comes to the point in which, if you look at the above cases listed by OP and Vishnu that a person... with a little looking... can see how the learning algorithm probable made the association. </p>

<p>So, I wouldn't really call it a mislabel on the part of the algorithm, or even call it a case where it's been tricked... rather a case where it's scope was developed incorrectly.</p>

<p>If the information an app's AI must learn arises within the app, from user interaction or error, it'd be smart if the program could log that kind of information and then look for patterns in the logs.  It could profile users to see ehat tasks are done most often, how many steps are needed.  Then when it recognizes that task recurring, it could ask the user if they wanted it to execute a macro that did the following [then it presents then with a list of the steps, allowing them to edit as needed].  Then it executes the 'macro' that it learned from observing the user.</p>

<p>Another use of AI is error detection, not only in the software, but in user error when the software was used inefficiently, redundantly, or improperly.  If the software were designed such that it was given a set of models of user tasks (like AI plans), it could observe users in the way they achieve known tasks, and offer suggestions or ask for confirmation that imminent unusual outcomes are intended.</p>

<p>And of course, AI could be used extensively in user interface design, on devices, web sites, or apps.  Some of this, like voice recognition, is entering the mainstream of daily use just now.  As conversations with apps that can add their own data and models of tasks/concepts/domains develop further, the need for AI <em>inside</em> the app will only grow.</p>

<p>There are a <em>ton</em> of ways that AI could be used in apps.  A few of these have started to arise in mobile devices and their apps, usually in fusion of user mobility with external web-based databases (e.g. GPS and maps), but IMO it's been slow.</p>

<p>Sure. Just provide a quality measure for the GA that's related in some manner to the effect of the player's actions on the game state/opponent(s). </p>

<p>Computer games, however either needs to run in real-time (no time for training) or turn-based (not enough data for training).</p>

1048,1048,,,"<p>As you mentioned in the question, you cannot solve all problems with decision trees.  Decision trees usually works well in a turn-based game with a good heuristic function, but in RTS games takes a different approach.</p>

<p>In the case of a very complex RTS game, one could implemented a rule-based AI. For example</p>

<ul>
<li>given it is the early game use all units to scout for resources</li>
<li>if a certain criteria is met build the base a certain way</li>
<li>if another criteria is met build an army</li>
<li>if the army is big enough, attack</li>
<li>if being attacked by the enemy, bring the units back to the base to defend</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these rules could implement various other AI technique, for example use A-star to find the optimal path between a unit's current location and destination.</p>

<p>Further optimization could be done by ""grouping"" similar units to act like one unit. e.g. calculate the path for the entire group instead of each individual unit.</p>

<p>You could also add finer grained rules, like if enemy is a certain distance from a unit, move closer and attack or retreat to the base (depending on health, ammo, abilities, etc).</p>

<p>The benefit of this approach is that a rule-based system executes very fast as no training or decision trees are necessary and this frees up a lot of system resources for visuals like physics and graphics.  </p>

<p>The disadvantage is that if the rule system is not complex enough, the player will easily recognize the pattern and the game will become predictable and boring.  You will also notice that the more different units you add to the game, the exponentially more complex the rule system becomes as you have to cater and test interaction between each type of unit in the game otherwise players might find a weakness in the game design and exploit to complete missions in ways it was not designed to be completed.</p>

<p>One of the reasons why multi-player games are so popular is that you do not play against set rules, but against creative people who have the ability to comes up with new strategies you had never seen before.</p>

<p>I hope you are not talking about the neural networks which are currently winning all competitions in machine learning (MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, Deep Residual Networks, ...). Those were once used as a model for neurons, but they are only <em>very</em> loosely related to what happens in real brain cells.</p>

<li><strong>Emulation</strong>: You assume it would only need one cycle to simulate a biological neuron. However, it needs many thousand cycles. You can't simply use more computational units, because some things are not parallelizable. For example, think of the function <code>f(x) = sin(x*x + 1)</code>. For a human, there are basically three computations: <code>r1 = x*x</code>, <code>r2 = r1 + 1</code>, <code>r3 = sin(r2)</code>. Even if you have 3 people working on calculating the result, you will not be faster than the single fastest person in this group is. Why? Because you need the results of the last computation. </li>

<p>These projects don't try to create chips that are optimised to <em>run</em> a neural network. That would certainly be possible, but the expensive part is the <em>training</em> not the running of neural networks. And for the training you need huge matrix multiplications, something GPUs are very good at already.

<p>To do research on algorithms that might be implemented in the brain (we hardly know anything about that) you need flexibility, something these chips don't have.

<p>So, you could create a chip designed after some neural architecture and it would be faster, more efficient, etc …, but to do that you'll need to know which architecture works first.

<p>Can you give me hints or futher articles, which deal with my questions below? As a beginner, I do not have an overview, yet. Preferably, your suggestions should also be connected to the following areas already: deep learning, reinforcement learning (, multiagent systems)</p>

<hr>

<p>(1)</p>

<p>If you have a card game and the AI shall play a card from its hand, you could think about the cards (amongst other stuff) as the current game state. You can easily define some sort of neural net and feed it with the card data. In a trivial case the cards are just numbered. I do not know the net type, which would be suitable, but I guess deep reinforcment learning strategies could be applied easily then.</p>

<p>However, I can only imagine this, if there is a constant number of hand cards. In the examples above, the number of pixels is also constant, for example. What if a player can have a different numbers of cards? What to do, if a player can have an infinite number of cards? Of course, this is just a theoretical question as no game has an infinite number of cards.</p>

<hr>

<p>(2)</p>

<p>In the initial examples, the action space is constant. What can you do, if the action space is not? This more or less follows from my previous problem. If you have 3 cards, you can play card 1, 2 or 3. If you have 5 cards, you can play card 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, etc. It is also common in card games, that it is not allowed to play a card. Could this be tackled with negative reward?</p>

<hr>

<p>So, which ""tricks"" can be used, e.g. always assume a constant number of cards with ""filling values"", which is only applicable in the non-infinite case (anyways unrealistic and even humans could not play well with that)?

<p>I am confused as what constitutes a time-step. Say I take a action now, so I will get a reward in 1 time-step. Then, I will take an action again in timestep 2 to get a second reward in time-step 3
But the equation says something else. How does one define a time-step? Can we take action as well receive a reward in a single step? Examples are most helpful.</p>

Keep in mind that this only answers the part of the question pertaining to NTMs, not Google DeepMind itself, plus I'm still learning the ropes in machine learning, so some of the material in these papers is over my head; I did manage to grasp much of the material in <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.5401.pdf"">Graves et al.'s original paper</a>{1] though and am close to having homegrown NTM code to test. I also at least skimmed the following papers over the last few months; they do not replicate the NTM study in a strict scientific manner, but many of their experimental results do tend to support the original at least tangentially:</p>

<p>• In <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.00036.pdf"">this paper</a> on a variant version of NTM addressing, Gulcehere, et al. do not try to precisely replicate Graves et al.'s tests, but like the DeepMind team, it does demonstrate markedly better results for the original NTM and several variants over an ordinary recurrent LSTM. They use 10,000 training samples of a Facebook Q&amp;A dataset, rather than the N-grams Graves et al. operated on in their paper, so it's not replication in the strictest sense. They did however manage to get a version of the original NTM and several variants up and running, plus recorded the same magnitude of performance improvement.<a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.00036.pdf"">2</a></p>

<p>• Unlike the original NTM, <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00521"">this study</a> tested a version of reinforcement learning which was not differentiable; that may be why they were unable to solve several of the programming-like tasts, like Repeat-Copy, unless the controller wasn't confined to moving forwards. Their results were nevertheless good enough to lend support to the idea of NTMs. A more recent revision of their paper is apparently available, which I have yet to read, so perhaps some of their variant's problems have been solved.<a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00521"">3</a></p>

<p>• Instead of testing the original flavor of NTM against ordinary neural nets like LSTMs, <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.03931v3.pdf"">this paper</a> pitted it against several more advanced NTM memory structures. They got good results on the same type of programming-like tasks that Graves et al. tested, but I don't think they were using the same dataset (it's hard to tell from the way their study is written just what datasets they were operating on).<a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.03931v3.pdf"">4</a> </p>

<p>• On p. 8 of <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06065.pdf"">this study</a>, an NTM clearly outperforms several LSTM, feed-forward and nearest-neighbor based schemes on an Omniglot character recognition dataset. An alternative approach to external memory cooked up by the authors clearly beats it, but it still obviously performs well. The authors seem to belong to a rival team at Google, so that might be an issue when assessing replicability.<a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06065.pdf"">5</a></p>

<p>• On p. 2 <a href=""http://www.thespermwhale.com/jaseweston/ram/papers/paper_6.pdf"">these authors</a> reported getting better generalization on ""very large sequences"" in a test of copy tasks, using a much smaller NTM network they evolved with the genetic NEAT algorithm, which dynamically grows topologies.<a href=""http://www.thespermwhale.com/jaseweston/ram/papers/paper_6.pdf"">6</a>  </p>

<p>NTMs are fairly new so there hasn't been much time to stringently replicate the original research yet, I suppose. The handful of papers I skimmed over the summer, however, seem to lend support to their experimental results; I have yet to see any that report anything but excellent performance. Of course I have an availability bias, since I only read the pdfs I could easily find in a careless Internet search. From that small sample it seems that most of the follow-up research has been focused on extending the concept, not replication, which would explain the lack of replicability data. I hope that helps.</p>

1087,1087,2240.0,3.0,"<p>There is this claim around that the brain's cognitive capabilities are tightly linked to the way it processes sensorimotor information and that, in this or a similar sense, our intelligence is ""embodied"". Lets assume, for the sake of argument, that this claim is correct (you may think the claim is too vague to even qualify for being correct, that it's ""not even false"". If so, I would love to hear your ways of fleshing out the claim in such a way that it's specific enough to be true or false). Then, since arguably at least chronologically in our evolution, most of our higher level cognitive capabilities come after our brain's way of processing sensorimotor information, this brings up the question what it is about the way that our brains function that make them particularly suitable for the processing of sensorimotor information? What makes our brains'  architecture particularly suitable for being an information processing unit inside a body? This is my first question. And what I'm hoping for are answers that go beyond the <em>a fortiori</em> reply ""Our brain is so powerful and dynamic, it's great for <em>any</em> task, and so also for processing sensorimotor information""</p>

<p>My second question is basically the same but instead of the human brain I want to ask for neural networks. What are the properties of neural networks that makes them <em>particularly</em> suitable for processing the kind of information that is produced by a body? Here are some of the reasons why people think neural networks are powerful:</p>

<ul>
<li>The universal approximation theorem (of FFNNs)</li>
<li>their ability to learn and self-organise</li>
<li>Robustness to local degrading of information</li>
<li>their ability to abstract/coarse-grain/convolute features, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>While I see how these are real advantages when it comes to evolution picking its favorite model for an embodied AI, none of them (or their combination) seems to be unique to neural networks. So they don't provide a satisfactory answer to my question. What makes a neural network a more suitable structure for embodied AI than, say, having a literal Turing machine sitting inside our head, or any other structure that is capable of universal computation? For instance, I really don't see how neural networks would be a particularly natural choice for dealing with geometric information. But geometric information is pretty vital when it comes to sensorimotor information, no?</p>

<p>Then, Common Lisp is great for symbolic AI. However, many recent machine learning libraries are coded in more mainstream languages, for example <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow"" rel=""noreferrer"">TensorFlow</a> is coded in C++ &amp; Python. <a href=""http://machinelearningmastery.com/popular-deep-learning-libraries/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Deep learning libraries</a> are mostly coded in C++ or Python or C (and sometimes using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL"" rel=""noreferrer"">OpenCL</a> or Cuda for GPU computing parts).</p>

<li>it is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>homoiconic</strong></a>, so it is easy to deal with programs as data, in particular it is easy to generate [sub-]programs, that is use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming"" rel=""noreferrer"">meta-programming</a> techniques.</li>
<li>it has a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop"" rel=""noreferrer"">Read-Eval-Print Loop</a> to ease interactive programming</li>
<li>it provides a very powerful <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_%28computer_science%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">macro</a> machinery (essentially, you define your own domain specific sublanguage for your problem), much more powerful than in other languages like C.</li>
<li>it mandates a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_%28computer_science%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">garbage collector</a> (even code can be garbage collected)</li>
<li>it provides many <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_%28abstract_data_type%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">container</a> abstract data types, and can easily handle symbols.</li>
<li>you can code both high-level (dynamically typed) and low-level (more or less startically typed) code, thru appropriate annotations.</li>
</ul>

<p>However most machine learning &amp; neural network libraries are not coded in CL. Notice that neither neural network nor deep learning is in the symbolic artificial intelligence field. See also <a href=""http://ai.stackexchange.com/q/35/3335"">this question</a>.</p>

<p>Notice that the programming language might not be very important. In the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence"" rel=""noreferrer"">Artificial General Intelligence</a> research topic, some people work on the idea of a AI system which would generate all its own code (so are designing it with a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_%28compilers%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">bootstrapping</a> approach).

<li>Easy to define a new language and manipulate complex information.</li>
<li>Full flexibility in defining and manipulating programs as well as data.</li>
<li>Fast, as program is concise along with low level detail. </li>
<li>Good programming environment (debugging, incremental compilers, editors).</li>

<p>Most of my friends into this field usually use Matlab for Artificial Neural Networks and Machine Learning. It hides the low level details though. If you are only looking for results and not how you get there, then Matlab will be good. But if you want to learn even low level detailed stuff, then I will suggest you go through LISP at-least once.<br>
Language might not be that important if you have the understanding of various AI algorithms and techniques. I will suggest you to read <em>""Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (by Stuard J. Russell and Peter Norvig""</em>. I am currently reading this book, and it's a very good book.</p>

1092,1092,,,"<p>What is life? <strong>AND</strong> Is AI a living organism? <em>are two different questions</em>.<br>
The first question is more philosophical and dependent. It can change with time, reference to topic of discussion or something else. Today, one parameter to its definition is <em>mortality</em>. In future if we reach to a certain technological level where mortal beings were only part of history, then the definition will drop <strong>this</strong> parameter.<br><br>
Coming to the second question. AI started as field of study to make machines to think like humans (or take rational decisions). Giving life to machines was, or is, not a concern of AI developers (at-least not nowadays). Once I watched some videos of Michio Kaku, where he talked about consciousness along with AI.<br>
Suppose human has a conscious level of 10. Then a thermostat might have the conscious level of 1 as it can sense when the surrounding is hot or cold and then take decision. Similarly a rat can have a conscious level 7 (or something). And the levels are of exponential order (not a linear scale). Similarly you can develop an AI program and check what level of consciousness it has achieved. Then you can decide whether it is living or not. ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence) will have a lower level of consciousness level than AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) will have consciousness level higher than the other two, and way higher than any human being.<br><br>
To judge whether an AI program is living or not you need a concrete definition of <strong>""LIFE""</strong>. Your definition can include various parameters like consciousness, adaptability, metabolism (or another method of generating energy for use), rational behavior, intelligence , learning through experience, etc. etc. etc.<br>
But the thing in the end is that its your definition. There are many definitions of ""LIFE"" out there. You can't judge a program for life by all definitions, as some of the definitions are contrary to others.<br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, answer to whether an AI program is living or not, is that <strong>IT DEPENDS</strong>. Depends on your definition of life.</p>

1093,1093,,,"<p>To my mind the essential reason why neural networks and the brain are powerful is that they create a hierarchical model of data or of the world. If you ask why that makes them powerful, well, that's just the structure of the world. If you are stalked by a wolf, it's not like its upper jaw will attack you frontally, while his lower jaw will attack you from behind. If you want to respond to the threat with a feasible computational effort, you'll have to treat the wolf as one entity. Providing these kinds of entities or concepts from the raw bits and bytes of input is what a hierarchical representation does. </p>

<p>Now, this is quite intuitive for sensory information: lashes, iris, eyebrow make up an eye, eyes, nose and mouth make up a face and so on. What is less obvious, is the fact that motor control works exactly the same way! Only in reverse. If you want to lift your arm, you'll just lift it. But for your brain to actually realise this move, the high level command has to be broken down into precise signals for every muscle involved. And this is done by propagating the command down the hierarchy. </p>

<p>In the brain these two functions are strongly intertwined. You use constant sensory feedback to adapt your motor control and in many cases you'd be incapable of integrating your stream of sensory data into a coherent representation if you didn't have the additional information of what your body is doing to change that stream of data. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade"" rel=""nofollow"">Saccades</a> are a good example for that. </p>

<p>Of course this doesn't mean that our cognitive functions are dependent on the processing of sensorimotor information. I would be surprised if a pure thinking machine wouldn't be possible. There is however a specific version of this ""embodied intelligence hypothesis"" that sounds plausible to me: </p>

<p>Creating high level cognitive concepts with unsupervised learning is a really difficult problem. Creating high level motor representation might be significantly easier. The reason is that there is more immediate useful feedback. I have been thinking about how to provide a scaffolding for the learning of a hierarchy of cognitive concepts and one thing I could imagine is that high level cognitive concepts basically hitch a ride with the motor concepts.

1095,1095,,,"<p>BlindKungFuMaster's answer deals with the hierarchical nature of perception and bodily control, so I'll set that aside and try instead to answer why evolution would use neural networks for animal embodied cognition, and then try to answer if robots of other artificial animals would use the same system.</p>

<p>It's important to focus on animals as a whole, not just humans, because that's how evolution works--like the famous John Gall quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you could build a system with five moving parts that does sensorimotor control, but it needs all five parts working in order to function at all, evolution could not build that system except in the rarest of circumstances. </p>

<p>What evolution instead does is slowly extend functional systems. If having one light-sensitive cell connected to one muscle cell makes an organism more likely to survive, then you have the building blocks to add a second layer without inventing any new sorts of cells, because you already have the information-processing connector.</p>

<p>Neural networks are convenient for evolution because their organization matches the hierarchical nature of the problem <em>and</em> the same kind of cell is used everywhere. All you need is dendrites to receive signals, a way to compute the threshold and trigger if the received signal is higher, axons that can make it to other cells, and then branches at the end of the axon to serve as multipliers. You can arbitrarily extend the depth and breadth of the network just by adding more cells.</p>

<p>Neural networks are convenient for artificial sensorimotor control because they give you, in memory, access to lots of intermediate values. They're also convenient for the same reasons evolution found them convenient--we can just say what we expect the structure of the robotic control will look like, provide training data, and then eventually have a robot that works.</p>

<p>But there's lots of robotics where the control system is designed instead of learned. To take a very simple example, one <em>could</em> use machine learning on the thermostat problem, to learn what temperatures require the heater to be turned on and what temperatures require the air conditioner to be turned on. But this would be extra work <em>and</em> a less robust system than just designing the optimal control system ahead of time.</p>

<p>In control theory, there's a concept called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_control"" rel=""nofollow"">adaptive control</a>, where one of the state space parameters for the control system is a property of the system. For example, imagine a satellite; typically we think of the state space of the system as the position and velocity of the satellite in three dimensions, so six total coordinates. There's then a set of differential equations that describe how the satellite will move over time, and what would happen if we used the actuators on the satellite to change its velocity.</p>

<p>But part of those differential equations is the inertia of the satellite. That is, how much fuel we need to expend and how it'll affect the rotation and translation of the satellite depends on where the weight of the satellite is located. And this can change over time, as fuel is consumed or if it wasn't correctly measured to begin with. Adaptive control adds new states to the system to track the inertia, and then simultaneously updates its estimate of the inertia and uses that estimate to plan what controls are necessary to move to a desired position.</p>

<p>You could imagine solving this problem with neural networks, but we can fairly easily calculate the optimal solution from first principles. In that case, we don't need neural network-based control, but the end result will look something like it from the outside.</p>

<p>I don't think it is helpful to think about inside and outside processing, but rather processing along tracts and nodes,( closer to the receptor, available to consciousness,etc)but leaving aside this distinction, the brain architecture is suitable for processing information ( again what facet of information processing you are referring to is unclear), due to the number of specialized computations that derive from it's evolution.</p>

1098,1098,,,"<p>""Trap"" functions were introduced as a way to discuss how GAs behave on functions where sampling most of the search space would provide pressure for the algorithm to move in the wrong direction (wrong in the sense of away from the global optimum).</p>

<p>For example, consider a four-bit function f(x) such that</p>

<pre><code>f(0000) = 5
f(0001) = 1
f(0010) = 1
f(0011) = 2
f(0100) = 1
f(0101) = 2
f(0110) = 2
f(0111) = 3
f(1000) = 1
f(1001) = 2
f(1010) = 2
f(1011) = 3
f(1100) = 2
f(1101) = 3
f(1110) = 3
f(1111) = 4
</code></pre>

<p>That is, the fitness of a string is equal to the number of 1s in the string, except f(0000) is 5, the optimal solution. This function can be thought of as consisting of two disjoint pieces: one that contains the global optimum (0000) and another that contains the local optimum at its complement (1111). All points other than these have fitness values such that standard evolutionary algorithm dynamics would lead the algorithms to tend towards the local optimum at 1111 rather than the global optimum at 0000.</p>

<p>That's basically what is meant by a trap function. You can consider variations on this theme, but that's the gist of it.</p>

<p>That said, I don't think I understand what question you're asking. I don't know what you have in mind by ""to experiment how much the algorithm is discerning of the correct global optimum"".</p>

<p>This is just a general description, actual one is more complicated. Or the bot can have a memory where it stores all its previous decision and incorporate those while taking new ones.<br>
This can be helpful if the bot wants to remember where an obstacle (like wall, in this case bot don't want to go and check the presence of wall each and every single time it is turned on) is, or where it is more probable to find dirt. If the bot is not remembering its history then it will be scanning the whole house over and over again, sensing the same obstacle every time and going across them.<br>
Bot which keeps no log of its history will take the same procedure again and again, making the same mistakes again and again. This is not an efficient way and a waste of its energy (or battery).<br><br>
Normally today bots have ordinary sensors which can only sense the dirt and obstacle. This limits the number of tasks a bot can perform. If a bot has decent camera as a sensor, and some algorithms of Image Processing are dumped into it, then it increases the tasks it can perform. Like detecting the stairs and cleaning different floors. Normally <strong>stairs will be considered obstacle and bot will just go around them</strong>. In case, when camera sensor is provided, <strong>stairs are potentially a path to be taken</strong>.<br><br>
<strong>A*</strong> algorithm is not necessarily used in case when the bot is not remembering the map of the house (or room). A normal robot which just scans the room and cleans it, will not be needing, as it don't know it's destination. Its only goal is to clean if it finds something dirty. But a bot which knows the map of the room and where there is a high probability of finding dirt, the A* algorithm can be used.</p>

<p>Let me tl;dr for you: (My abstract addition in Italics)</p>

<p>Novel method for speaker identification based on both speech utterances and their transcribed text. </p>

<p><em>They first</em> transcribed text of each speaker’s is processed by <em>using</em> probabilistic latent semantic indexing (PLSI) that model<em>s</em> each speaker’s vocabulary which <em>is</em> closely related to his/her identity, function, or expertise. </p>

<p><em>The speech to text used by users is DARPA's Efficient, Affordable, Reusable Speech-to-Text (EARS) Program in MetadataExtraction (MDE).</em></p>

<p><em>By using</em> Melfrequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and dynamic range is quantized to a number of predefined bins in order to compute MFCC local histograms for each speech utterance, which is time-aligned with the transcribed text. </p>

<p><em>To test they used</em> RT-03 MDE Training Data Text and Annotations corpus distributed by the Linguistic Data Consortium.</p>

<p><em>As for results:</em> Identification rate versus Probe ID when 44 speakers are employed. Average identification rates for (a) PLSI: 69%; (b) MFCCs: 66%; (c) Both: 67%.</p>

<li>without (QM) a number of things simply cannot be simulated</li>

If you think about it, they are actually programs, composed of sequences of data. They are not written in C++ or Java, instead they use <em>3-D Protein Interaction</em>. They evolve with time and their evolution is the reason that species are able to survive even when their surroundings experience tragic changes. <br>

This is where a program can have understanding of it's environment just like humans. Perception, rational behavior and others will be part of this program.</li>
<li>Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI): This is basically the ultimate level of AI. Average predicted date for a successful ASI is between 2045-2080.

<p>It's a CNN with several layers, ending with 10 outputs, one for each type of object recognized.</p>

<p>But now think of a slightly different problem: Let's say I only want to recognize one type of object, but also detect its position within the image frame. Let's say I want to distinguish between:</p>

<ul>
<li>object is in center</li>
<li>object is left of center</li>
<li>object is right of center</li>
<li>no recognizable object</li>
</ul>

<p>Assume I build a CNN exactly like the one in the CIFAR-10 example, but only with 3 outputs:</p>

<ul>
<li>center</li>
<li>left</li>
<li>right</li>
</ul>

<p>And of course, if none of the outputs fires, then there is no recognizable object.</p>

<p>Assume I have a large training corpus of images, with the same kind of object in many different positions within the image, the set is grouped and annotated properly, and I train the CNN using the usual methods.</p>

<p>Should I expect the CNN to just ""magically"" work? Or are there different kinds of architectures required to deal with object position? If so, what are those architectures?</p>

It is a computer program that is <strong>developed by Google DeepMind</strong> to play the board game ""Go"". The game is different than other games, as <strong>The number of potential legal board positions is greater than the number of atoms in the universe</strong>. It has way more legal board positions than the chess. So, <em>AlphaGo</em> requires different technique for it's development.<br><br>
Program's victories against the best players in the world in March 2016 <strong>is considered a major break through</strong> in the field of AI. Go was previously considered to be a hard problem and many experts believed that current technology is not enough. Experts were saying that it will take atleast 5 years (or may be 10 years) before we will have a well developed Go software player.<br><br>
The game used sophisticated algorithms of deep learning and reinforcement learning in order to learn the game. What makes this game different from other board game (like Chess, Reversi, etc.) is that moves are often based on intuition. If you ask a Chess player why he make a certain move, you will always be hearing an answer where he will explain you how he thought this move can increase in change of winning. Every move uses certain heuristics, strategy and/ or tricks. This is not the case with Go. Some moves are often taken because of intuition. Coding an AI software that can play a game, where intuition is a integral part of the game makes it different from other AIs that we have today.<br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The world’s oldest carmaker no longer sees the problem, similar to the question from 1967 known as the Trolley Problem, as unanswerable. Rather than tying itself into moral and ethical knots in a crisis, Mercedes-Benz simply intends to program its self-driving cars to save the people inside the car. Every time. </p>
  
  <p>All of Mercedes-Benz’s future Level 4 and Level 5 autonomous cars will prioritize saving the people they carry, according to Christoph von Hugo, the automaker’s manager of driver assistance systems and active safety.</p>

1142,1142,,,"<p>For a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Markov Decision Process (MDP)</a> a model which are the states (<em>S</em>), actions (<em>A</em>), rewards (<em>R</em>), and transition probabilites <em>P(s'|s,a)</em>. The goal is to obtain the best action to do in each of the states, i.e. the policy &pi;.</p>

<h2>Policy</h2>

<p>To calculate the policy we make use of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bellman equation</a>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/W2k5H.gif"" alt=""Bellman equation""></p>

<p>When starting to calculate the values we can simply start with:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/sYwIu.gif"" alt=""value_1""></p>

<p>To improve this value we should take into account the next action which can be taken by the system and will result in a new reward:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SdlF3.gif"" alt=""value_2""></p>

<p>Here you take into account the reward of the current state s: <em>R(s)</em>, and the weighted sum of possible future rewards. We use <em>P(s'|s,a)</em> to give the probility of reaching state <em>s'</em> from <em>s</em> with action <em>a</em>. &gamma; is a value between 0 and 1 and is called the <em>discount factor</em> because it reduces the importance of future rewards since these are uncertain. An often used value is &gamma;=0.95.</p>

<p>When using <a href=""http://artint.info/html/ArtInt_227.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">value iteration</a> this process is continued until the value function has <em>converged</em>, which means that the value function does not change significantly when doing new iterations:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2dng1.gif"" alt=""convergence""></p>

<p>where &varepsilon; is a really small value.</p>

<h2>Discounted sum of future rewards</h2>

<p>If you look at the Bellman equation and execute it iteratively you'll see:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fl91c.gif"" alt=""nested bellman""></p>

<p>This is like (without transition functions):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jiPdr.gif"" alt=""R sum""></p>

<h2>To conclude</h2>

<p>So when we start in state <em>s</em> we want to take the action that gives us the best total reward taking into account not only the current, or next state, but all possible next states until we reach the goal. These are the time steps you refer to, i.e. each action taken is done in a time step. And when we learn the policy we try to take into account as many time steps as possible to choose the best action.</p>

<p>A generative model will be trained to model the properties of class A and another one will be trained to model the properties of class B. If we want to know if a new sample belongs to class A or B, we will compare it to each model and decide. The advantage is that we are able to synthetically generate more samples of these classes using the generative property of the model. The models have a ""global knowledge"" of what the classes are.</p>

  <p>Can there ever be a functionally complete set of grammar rules which can parse any statement in English (locale-specific) accurately and which can be possibly implemented for use in AI-based projects?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Parse it yes, accurately most likely no.</p>

<p>Why ? </p>

<p>According to my understanding on how we derive meaning from sounds, there are 2 complementary strategies:</p>

<p><strong>Grammar Rules:</strong>
A rule based system for ordering words to facilitate communication, here meaning is derived from interaction of discrete sounds and their independent meaning, so you could parse a sentence based on a rule book.</p>

<p>E.G. <strong><em>""This was a triumph""</em></strong> : the parser would extract a pronoun (<strong>This</strong>) with corresponding meaning ( a specific person or thing ) ; a verb (<strong>was</strong>) with corresponding meaning ( occurred ); ( <strong>a</strong>) and here we start with some parsing problems , what would the parser extract, a noun or an indefinite article ? An so we consult the grammar rule book, and settle for the meaning ( indefinite article any one of ), you have to parse the next word  and refer to it though, but let's gloss over that for now, and finally (<strong>triumph</strong>) a noun ( it could also be a verb, but thanks to the grammar rule book we settled for a noun with meaning: ( victory,conquest), so in the end we have ( joining the meanings ):</p>

<p><strong>A specific thing occurred of victory.</strong> Close enough and I am glossing over a few other rules, but that's not the point, the other strategy is:</p>

<p><strong>A lexical dictionary (or lexicon)</strong>
Where words or sounds are associated with specific meaning. Here meaning is derived from one or more words or sounds as a unit. This introduces the problem to a parser, since well, it shouldn't parse anything.</p>

<p>E.G. <strong><em>""Non Plus Ultra""</em></strong> And so the AI parser would recognize that this phrase is not to be parsed and instead matched with meaning :</p>

<p>The highest point or culmination</p>

<p>Lexical units introduce another issue in that they themselves could be part of the first example, and so you end up with recursion.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if it is possible for a computer to parse a well-versed sentence written in English as if it were parsed by an adult English-speaking human?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe it could be possible, most examples I've seen deal effectively with the grammar rule book or the lexicon part, but I am not aware of a combination of both, but in terms of programming, it could happen.</p>

<p>Unfortunately even if you solve this problem, your AI would not really understand things in the strict sense, but rather present you with very elaborate synonyms, additionally context (as mentioned in the comments) plays a role into the grammar and lexicon strategies. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If it cannot be represented using simple grammar rules, what kind of semantic structure can be used to generalize it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A mixed one where there are both grammar rules and a lexicon and both can change and be influenced based on the AI specific context and experience as well as a system for dealing with these objects could be one way.</p>

<p>For example, that this ""sentence"":</p>

<p><strong>This sentence no verb</strong></p>

<p>Technically it's not a sentence at all, since it doesn't have a verb.  But did anybody have any problem understanding what it meant? Doubtful.  Try coming up with a formal rule for that though.  And that's just one example.</p>

<p>Now, could you come up with a formal grammar that covers, maybe, 90% of cases, and is ""good enough"" for most practical uses? Possibly, maybe even probably.  But I am pretty sure it's not possible to get to 100%.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>number of neurons in AI systems </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The number of neurons in AI systems is a little tricky to calculate, Neural Networks and Deep Learning are 2 current AI systems as you call them, specifics are hard to come by (If someone has them please share), but data on parameters do exist, parameters are more analogous to synapses (connections) than neurons (the nodes in between connections) somewhere in the range of 100-160 billion is the current upper number for specialized networks.</p>

<p>Deriving the number of neurons in AI systems from this number is a stretch since these AIs emulate certain types of connections and sub assemblies of neurons, but let's continue...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>equal those of the human brain?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So now let's look at the brain, and again this are all contested numbers. Number of neurons ~ 86 Billion, Number of Synapses ~ 150 Trillion, another generalization: average number of synapses per neuron ~ 1,744.</p>

<p>So now we have something to compare, and I can't stress this enough, these are all wonky numbers, so let's make our life a little easier and divide :</p>

<p>Number of Synapses (Brain ) : 150 trillion /  Number of parameters AIs : 150 billion = 1,000 or in other words current AIs would have to scale by a factor of one thousand their connections to be on par with the brain...</p>

<p>Number of Neurons (Brain ) : 86 Billion / Number of Neurons AIs ( 150 billion / 1,744 )  = 86 Million equivalent AI Neurons</p>

<p>Which makes sense, mathematically at least : you can multiply the factor ( 1000 ) times the current number of equivalent AI Neurons ( 86 million) to get the number of neurons in the human brain (86 Billion)</p>

<p>Within every field there are still other subfields and problems that are not solved yet. For example, development of human-like natural language processing (NLP) is necessary for intelligent agent to pass any verbal tests, or even non-verbal tests that requires processing of sentences of human language. Famous test that tests intelligence by asking questions in natural language and expects answers in the same form is Turing test. NLP still struggles with many (basic) human skills like listening, speaking, parsing and forming sentences. No one knows when we'll have system that can do these things as good as human. Since this system is crucial, but also far from human-like it's likely cause of delay in developing AI that passes intelligence test. Are these problems AI-hard? Do we need to develop strong AI to solve them?</p>

<p>You can look at speech and listening as interfaces used for expressing and affecting inner processes of human brain. Same goes for other senses like eyesight which is being approximated by computer vision. One could say that we only need to develop convincing mimics of human senses and incorporate them in one big system that will become first human-like AI. That is the minimum requirement. <strong>I doubt this will be achieved in this century.</strong></p>

<p>(Other thoughts)<br/>
What truly defines intelligence is brain activity. Since it's really complex and one artificial neuron is not equal to one neuron in brain, increase in computation power will not necessarily help achieving human-like AI. Also recognizing such system by mere intelligence test is questionable. For now it's only philosophical discussion but by the time we are able to design such machine I think we'll also have better understanding of human brain. Someone in 2100 might not read this answer on quantum computer with integrated AI OS powered from fusion reactor in his self-flying car, but will probably have many systems that help him in everyday tasks far more than we imagine today.</p>

  <p>Will Artificial Intelligence some day become a problem to humanity
  after learning human behaviors and characteristics?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It can be answered in both ways, I think.</p>

<p><strong>Yes, they may become a problem.</strong></p>

<p>With the increasing integration of loads of apps and smart devices in our life, almost everything defining an individual human being is digitalised. For instance, our fingerprints, voice, facial image etc. Apart from these data, we use those apps and devices to track our health (heart rate, calorie intake etc), to plan our schedules, and most importantly to communicate. If some sort of AI engine is integrated into a chat application, for instance, it can learn our typing patterns, conversation style, and hundreds of other unforeseen parameters. Imagine what can be learned about a person if such AI is coded inside every device and every app in your day-to-day use.</p>

<p>We use smart devices and apps to harness their functionalities and features which ease our way of life, and we give them, unintentionally, our identity and sometimes, even our personality. For them, these are the parameters that can be input to some machine-learning algorithm and predict what we will do the next day, or what will happen to us the next day.</p>

<p>This sounds like a major problem, especially when these technologies are indispensable.</p>

<p><strong>No, they may not become a problem.</strong></p>

<p>Humans are really complex creatures and possess the most advanced intelligence technology called the brain. I think the brain can be thought of as a technology in this context. There are several tissues inside the brain that can learn to do certain things themselves. It was proven in a research that some tissues have the capability to perform the functions of other tissues using neuro-rewiring techniques. Imagine that the same tissue that has helped you see until now can be made to help you hear instead. Now imagine mimicking such a technology.</p>

<p>While it is not impossible, for an AI to achieve the brilliance of a human brain is a topic of ongoing research. To train a machine for the purpose, we would have to feed it with gazillion behaviors and characteristics, which it may not be able to handle! After learning some behavior and characteristics, the AI would be said to be smart, but it would still predate us.</p>

<p>So, they may not become a problem at all because of our brain.</p>

<p>The algorithms (like recommender systems) used by Amazon and Facebook influence us or even manipulate us. But, that manipulation is either very obvious (like viewing promoted products) or is in company's best interests (like viewing a certain news piece). It may be even possible that several external parameters are used by these systems to improve your experience. For instance, Google ads show us what we were looking for on an online store when we visit any random website. In most cases, what you see is a result of what you were looking for before. If any attempt to influence does happen, we may learn to avoid it through careful observation or even experience.</p>

1184,1184,2384.0,2.0,"<p>Background:
I've been interested in, and reading about, Neural Networks for several years, but I haven't gotten around to testing them out until recently. Both for fun and to increase my understanding, I tried to write a class library from scratch in .Net.
For tests, I've tried some simple functions, such as generating output identical to the input, working with the MNIST dataset, and a few binary functions (two input OR, AND and XOR, with two outputs: one for true, one for false).
Everything seemed fine when I used a sigmoid function as the activation function but, reading of the ReLUs I decided to switch over for speed.</p>

<p>My current problem is that, when I switch to using ReLUs, I found that I was unable to train a network of any complexity (tested from as few as 2 internal nodes up to a mesh of 100x100 nodes) to correctly function as an XOR gate. I see two possibilities here:</p>

<p>1) My implementation is faulty,
(This one is frustrating, as I've re-written the code multiple times in various ways, and I still get the same result),</p>

<p>2) Aside from being faster or slower to train, there are some problems that are impossible to solve given a specific activation function,
(Fascinating idea, but I've no idea if it's true or not)</p>

<p>My inclination is to think that 1) above is correct. However, given the amount of time I've invested, it would be nice if I could rule out 2) definitively before I spend even more time going over my implementation.</p>

<p>Edit for specifics:
For the XOR network, I have tried both using two inputs (0 for false, 1 for true), and using four inputs (each pair, one signals true and one false, per ""bit"" of input).
I have also tried using 1 output (with a 1 (realy, >0.9) corresponding to true and a 0 (or &lt;0.1) corresponding to false), as well as two outputs (one signaling true and the other false).</p>

<p>Each training epoch, I run against four sets of input: 00->0, 01->1, 10->1, 11->0.</p>

<p>I find that the first three converge towards correct answer, but the final input (11) converges towards 1, even though I train it with an expected value of 0.</p>

<p>Edit: The solution is simpler than I thought. The output layer needs connections, not just to the intermediate layer, but directly to the input layer as well. This allows the network to train XOR effectively.</p>

<p>Edit 2: One final note, the XOR is EXTREMELY sensitive to the learning rate. Essentially, whatever learning rate is appropriate for the AND and OR functions, is approximately 1000x too large to train XOR effectively.</p>

<p>In practical terms, program would extract sentences ""i like cats"", ""says he likes cats"", ""cats that John likes"" etc. We need part that recognizes something as a quote, part that extracts it and finally parser so we end up with structure stored in some form that contains meaning of sentence (john-like-cats). Also it can keep information of time and context in which it was said, like timestamp of an article, some proper nouns that can indicate place (XY conference, London...). Now, suspicious article can be compared and checked if it matches time, place, some context and contains quote that is similar. Finally it needs to compare how different it is from other quotes. ""...hates cats"" should be labeled as potential fake news, but ""likes dogs"", ""thinks cats are OK"", ""sings well"" etc. should not. This can be expanded into comparison of whole articles.</p>

<p>Today corporations are granted rights: to own property, earn income, pay taxes, contribute to political campaigns, offer opinion in public, ad more.

Conversely, any corporation already in existence could become fully automated at any time (and some plausibly will).  In doing so, they should not lose any of the rights and duties they currently employ.</p>

<p>Could this schizoid sense of human identity be resolved at some point?  Sure.  Already there have been numerous laws introduced and some passed elevating various nonhuman species to higher levels of civil rights that only humans heretofore enjoyed: chimpanzees, cetaceans, parrots and others have been identified as 'higher functioning' and longer lived, and so, are now protected from abuse in ways that food animals, pets, and lab animals are not.  </p>

<p>The technique works as follows:</p>

<li>Solve the problem from the perspective of these other systems</li>

They present many pictures or sculptures (3). We could use our rooms and floors to decorate them with pictures and sculptures (4).</p>

<p>I'm thinking of a console application, where you can enter a conceptualized problem like ""methods for creative writing"", for example, and it uses the above method to find possible solutions of the issue. Of course no solution with extensive depth, more something like basic ideas derived from the knowledge database I have.</p>

<p>Lets take as an example a console application where someone asks ""how to write a novel"":</p>

<li>It should find out first that the system all is about is in the term ""novel"". To find a feature of that system it just searches concepts containing that term: it finds out ""Novel is a story"" So thats a feature.</li>
<li>Which systems are also stories? A good concept it should find is e.g. ""Plot is a story"". (Of course only when I am selecting the search results manually)--> <strong>How to find best concepts of a list when not knowing which fits best?</strong></li>
<li>It should then find out that a plot is written using a storyline: ""storyline is a plot""</li>

<p>AGI can easily determine which input is true/real. It will use the same method which every organism uses: any input is true and real, unless you misidentified some other stuff as ""input"".</p>

<p>I would define input as: what crosses the boundary and enters your mind from outside of your mind. The minimum hardwired check is to make sure that signals generated inside a mind are not misidentified as coming from outside (aka ""I hear voices""). That's all. This is where the blockchain of truth begins and where it ends.</p>

<p>An Internet article? The input to AI is rather: one of AI's network interfaces received many bytes. Once it's verified they are from the network, and not imaginary, they cannot be unreal or untrue in any meaningful way. By that definition of input, it is in fact the <em>only</em> thing we can be sure is true and real.</p>

<p>Of course AI will likely form hypotheses regarding these bytes that happen to contain ASCII strings like ""Trump"", ""John Smith"", ""ice balls on Siberian beaches"". Then AI will hopefully make predictions based on these hypotheses, maybe interact, maybe get some new input, reject the hypothesis and make a new one, rinse and repeat.</p>

<p>The first hypothesis will be super-naive, but the hundredth, the thousandth?</p>

<p>If you end this process prematurely - maybe for lack of processing power -  you will get something you called a ""<em>belief</em>"". (Like a belief that some emotional web page might actually reveal a significant truth about our political system.) That <em>belief</em> is a synonym of ""tired with trying new hypotheses, will stick to this one"". Typical human thing. AI will have less of that, I hope, due to having much much more processing capabilities. AI will stick less to the high-school-level truth that you should assign great credibility to statements written in a form of a newspaper article, it will hopefully form more and more generations of hypotheses, and check them.</p>

1209,1209,,,"<p>I have considered much of the responses here, and I would suggest that most people here have missed the point when answering the question about emotions.</p>

<p>The problems is, scientists keep looking for a single solution as to what emotions are. This is akin to looking for a single shape that will fit all different shaped slots.</p>

<p>Also, what is ignored is that animals are just as capable of emotions and emotional states as we are:</p>

<p>When looking on Youtube for insects fighting each other, or competing or courting, it should be clear that simple creatures experience them too!</p>

<p>When I challenge people about emotions, I suggest to them to go to Corinthians 13 - which describes the attributes of love. If you consider all those attributes, one should notice that an actual ""feeling"" is not required for fulfilling any of them.</p>

<p>Therefore, the suggestion that a psychopath lacks emotions, and so he commits crimes or other pursuits outside of ""normal"" boundaries is far from true, especially when one considers the various records left to us from court cases and perhaps psychological evaluation - which show us that they do act out of ""strong"" emotions.</p>

<p>It should be considered that a psychopath's behaviour is motivated out of negative emotions and emotional states with a distinct lack of or disregard of morality and a disregard of conscience. Psychopaths ""enjoy"" what they do.</p>

<p>I am strongly suggesting to all that we are blinded by our reasoning, and by the reasoning of others.</p>

<p>Though I do agree with the following quote mentioned before: -</p>

<p>Dave H. wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From a computational standpoint, emotions represent global state that influences a lot of other processing. Hormones etc. are basically
  just implementation. A sentient or sapient computer certainly could
  experience emotions, if it was structured in such a way as to have
  such global states affecting its thinking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, his reasoning below it (that quote) is also seriously flawed.</p>

<p>Emotions are both active and passive: They are triggered by thoughts and they trigger our thoughts; Emotions are a mental state and a behaviourial quality; Emotions react to stimuli or measure our responses to them; Emotions are independant regulators and moderators; Yet they provoke our focus and attention to specific criteria; and they help us when intuition and emotion agree or they hinder us when conscience or will clash.</p>

<p>A computer has the same potential as us to feel emotions, but the skill of implementing emotions is much more sophisticated than the one solution fits all answer people are seeking here.</p>

<p>Also, if anyone argues that emotions are simply ""states"" where a response or responses can be designed around it, really does not understand the complexity of emotions; the ""freedom"" emotions and thoughts have independently of each other; or what constitutes true thought!</p>

<p>Programmers and scientists are notorious for ""simulating"" the real experiences of emotions or intelligence, without understanding the intimate complexities; Thinking that in finding the perfect simulation they have ""discovered"" the real experience.</p>

<p>The Psi-theory seems to adequately give a proper understanding of the matter: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psi-theory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psi-theory</a></p>

<p>So I would say that the simulation of emotional states ""is"" equivalent to experiencing emotions, but those emotional states are far more complex than what most realise.</p>

If we, as humans can be fooled and disceived by what ""we"" consider a good sources of news, how can an artificially intelligent computer have any chance?</p>

<p>However, the challenge would be that an AI would have to be able to ""test"" a source of information against a known medium in order to <em>get to the truth</em>. This is a far different dynamic set of circumstances than what has been touted above.</p>

<p>For example, if it was claimed by a woman that a man raped her - which was not reported to the police - it is not enough to compare one person's statements to another in order to determine truth. This is because collusion, influenced or coherced third parties, mistaken perceptions and false beliefs would give false positives.</p>

<p>However, if an AI could establish from her statement that on the day she claimed to have been raped, that the alleged assailant was incapacitated while in her company, until she left his home, because the police report stated that she was upset with the assailant because he was asleep because of drugs during her whole stay. But, this police report comes from an independent source who states, Mr. ""x"" was asleep that day.</p>

<p>Doing a strict textual check is not going to give the correct answers. analysing her friends and associattes chatter could also confirm a false report as being true.</p>

In thinking about this a little more, SGD doesn't necessarily directly weaken weights, it only strengthens weights in the direction of the gradient and as a side-effect, weights get diminished for other states outside the gradient, correct?

However, what your definition of <em>plugged in</em> is unclear. </p>

<p>If you mean literally, and <em>physically</em>, plugged in to the wall then <strong>yes</strong>, as <a href=""http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/2400/is-it-possible-for-an-ai-to-work-in-a-computer-without-the-power-cord-being-plug#answer-2401"">Aus points out</a>, because one can use a battery, or have a solar powered circuit, or petrol/diesel/steam/water/wind/hydrogen/etc. powered engine, running a generator/alternator which can eventually supply a voltage and current to power the circuitry. However, in these examples, you have merely moved the point of generation, from a remote power station to a locally generated source of electricity - so it is still, in effect, <em>plugged in</em> (but to a local source). So, in that sense, the answer is <strong>no</strong>. </p>

<p>If you mean no external power source, <strong><em>what so ever</em></strong>, then the answer is most certainly <strong>no</strong>, as, again as <a href=""http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/2400/is-it-possible-for-an-ai-to-work-in-a-computer-without-the-power-cord-being-plug#answer-2401"">Aus has already said</a>, there is no way for electrons to be pushed around the circuit, and therefore the circuit is dead<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>If you mean, as you said in your <a href=""http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/2400/is-it-possible-for-an-ai-to-work-in-a-computer-without-the-power-cord-being-plug#comment-2620"">comment</a> that the AI has created its own electrical power source - although as <a href=""http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/2400/is-it-possible-for-an-ai-to-work-in-a-computer-without-the-power-cord-being-plug#answer-2401"">Ankur says in their answer</a>, this implies that the AI has the ability for its I/O manipulate its environment<sup>2</sup> - then as in the first paragraph, you have simply moved the point of the power source, so one can say that it is again now <em>plugged in</em>, again to a local energy source, and so yet again the answer is <strong>no</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p>However, if you are <em>not</em> referring to an electronic based computer, which is hosting the AI, but are, instead, referring to a <em>hypothetical biological</em> computer, then the answer is probably <strong>yes</strong> - in a sense. Although, that biological computer would still require energy input, as energy can't just be ""magicked"" out of thin air. It would need to be converted from one source into a from that the biological computer can use. That energy could come from a variety of sources, be it from sunlight, food,  heat (sunlight, deep sea vents, etc), so one could argue that it is still <em>plugged in</em> to an <em>energy source</em> and so yet again, the answer is <strong>no</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p>To be honest, in order to give an accurate, and sensible answer, you really need to reword your question, clarify what you mean and what your definitions of <em>plugged in</em> and <em>AI host</em> are. Unfortunately, your question, as it stands, is rather unanswerable, in as much that it is difficult to give a definitive answer.</p>

<p>That said, it is <em>possible</em> to build a single CNN that takes input of images as varying dimensions.  There are a number of ways you might try to do this, and I'm not aware of any published science analyzing these different choices.  The key is that the set of learned parameters needs to be shared between the different inputs sizes.  While convolutions can be applied at different images sizes, ultimately they always get converted to a single vector to make predictions with, and the size of that vector will depend on the geometries of the inputs, convolutions and pooling layers.  You'd probably want to dynamically change the pooling layers based on the input geometry and leave the convolutions the same, since the convolutional layers have parameters and pooling usually doesn't.  So on bigger images you pool more aggressively.</p>

<p>Practically you'd want to group together similarly (identically) sized images together into minibatches for efficient processing.  This is common for LSTM type models.

<p>But, The following is the exercise given by my teacher,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Exercise 1   Genetic algorithm to solve pattern finding problem. </p>
  
  <p>Your task is to design a simple genetic algorithm, with binary-coded chromosomes, in order  to solve pattern finding problem
  in 16-bit strings.  </p>
  
  <p>The objective function is given by the following
  formula:    </p>
  
  <p>F(x) = NoS(""010"") + 2NoS(""0110"") + 3NoS(""01110"") +
  4NoS(""011110"") +  5NoS(""0111110"") + 6NoS(""01111110"") +
  7NoS(""011111110"") + 6NoS(""0111111110"") +  5NoS(""01111111110"") +
  4NoS(""011111111110"") + 3NoS(""0111111111110"") +  2NoS(""01111111111110"")
  + NoS(""011111111111110"")    </p>
  
  <p>The algorithm should display each population on the screen in the form     And
  should save the history of it’s operation (average fitness in each
  population) in the text  file. At the end it should also display the
  best solution found.    </p>
  
  <p>You may use the following operators:  </p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>Reproduction.<br>
  You can use either one of the following reproduction
  types:  Proportional, Ranking, Tournament. They are described more in
  detail below:
  ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...</p></li>
  <li><p>Crossing over.<br>
  In order to perform this operation the individuals must be grouped in
  pairs (randomly), and  with certain probability pcross information
  from their chromosomes must be exchanged. There  are many flavors of
  the crossing-over operator, but in our case (short, 16-bit
  chromosome),  simple, one-point crossover will be enough. It can be
  performed by selecting a random  number k from the range &lt;1;15> and
  cutting the chromosomes of both individuals on that  position. Each of
  the individuals copies bits  belonging to the other to it’s own 
  chromosome.  </p></li>
  <li><p>Mutation<br>
  This operator changes the value of each bit in the chromosome to the opposite one with a very  small probability pm
  (usually about 10-3).  If we denote chromosome as [b1, b2, ... , b16];
  then after the mutation each bit can be  described as:  Where k Î
  {1,2, ...,16}  flip(x) – result of a Bernoulli flip with a success 
  probability x.</p></li>
  </ol>

<p>Keeping that in mind, <strong>a machine that appears to be expressing emotions would only be the result of a series of complicated algorithms</strong> allowing a computer to assess the situation and respond in an intellectually appropriate manner based on external stimulus and conditions.

1258,1258,,,"<p>Rick Briggs refers to the difficulty an artificial intelligence would have in detecting the true meaning of words spoken or written in one of our natural languages. Take for example an artificial intelligence attempting to determine the meaning of a sarcastic sentence. </p>

<p>Naturally spoken, the sentence ""That's just what I needed today!"" can be the expression of very different feelings. In one instance, a happy individual finding an item that had been lost for some time could be excited or cheered up from the event, and exclaim that this moment of triumph was exactly what their day needed to continue to be happy. On the other hand, a disgruntled office employee having a rough day could accidentally worsen his situation by spilling hot coffee on himself, and sarcastically exclaim that this further annoyance was exactly what he needed today. This sentence should in this situation be interpreted as the man expressing that spilling coffee on himself made his bad day worse.</p>

<p>This is one small example explaining the reason linguistic analysis is difficult for artificial intelligence. When this example is spoken, small tonal fluctuations and indicators are extremely difficult for an AI with a microphone to detect accurately; and if the sentence was simply read, without context how <em>would</em> one example be discernible from the other?</p>

<p>Rick Briggs suggests that Sanskrit, a form of communication sacred to Hinduism, is a naturally spoken language with mechanics and grammatical rules that would allow an artificial intelligence to more accurately interpret sentences during linguistic analysis. More accurate linguistic analysis would result in an artificial intelligence being able to respond more accurately.

<p>In my main body of text there are some substrings that I want to extract.  Note that I don't want to construct or generate new strings, the characters I extract must be part of the main text. Normally I would use a regex to extract this substring when the text and substring are relatively simple. </p>

<pre><code>... some text ...
Today, Fake Acme Corp. changed its name to Really Not Fake Acme Corp.
... some more text ...
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to extract the names <code>Fake Acme Corp.</code> and <code>Really Not Fake Acme Corp.</code></p>

<p>Points to keep in mind (aka why regex won't work):</p>

<ul>
<li>The format of the sentence is not fixed, neither is its location in
the document. The 2 names could be in different sentences.</li>
<li>There is no guarantee that the new company name will be related to the old name.</li>
<li>There is no guarantee that only 2 company names will be mentioned in the document (so standard CRF approaches that detect the <code>ORG</code> class  viz. <code>CoreNLP</code>/<code>OpenNLP</code> won't be of much help).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>WHAT I'VE TRIED</strong></p>

<p>The training dataset is ~5000 labeled examples. This can be expanded if necessary. Using a character encoding format as per <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01626"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""this paper &#40;Character-level CNNs&#41;"">this paper on character-level cnns</a> I constructed an LSTM network using <a href=""https://keras.io/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Keras</a> which took as input each character encoded in a one-hot format. The output was also a one-hot vector.</p>

<p>Eg: The input text is <code>1024</code> characters, encoded in a one-hot vector with an alphabet of <code>73</code> (see paper linked above for more on this). The output is a one-hot encoded vector that is the substring I want.</p>

<p>Input shape: <code>1024 x 73</code>, Output shape: <code>1024 x 73</code> (in the output only the characters that match the substring are one-hot, the rest of the rows are all <code>0</code>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In artificial intelligence, an expert system is a computer system that emulates the decision-making ability of a human expert. Expert systems are designed to solve complex problems by reasoning about knowledge, represented mainly as if–then rules rather than through conventional procedural code. The first expert systems were created in the 1970s and then proliferated in the 1980s. Expert systems were among the first truly successful forms of artificial intelligence (AI) software.</p>
  
  <p>An expert system is divided into two subsystems: the inference engine and the knowledge base. The knowledge base represents facts and rules. The inference engine applies the rules to the known facts to deduce new facts. Inference engines can also include explanation and debugging abilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CRUD webapps (websites that allows users to <strong>Create</strong> new entries in a database, <strong>Read</strong> existing entries in a database, <strong>Update</strong> entries within the database, and <strong>Delete</strong> entries from a database) are very common on the Internet. It is a vast field, encompassing both small-scale blogs to large websites such as StackExchange. The biggest commonality with all these CRUD apps is that they have a knowledge base that users can easily add and edit.</p>

<p>CRUD webapps, however, use the knowledge base in many, myriad and complex ways. As I am typing this question on StackOverflow, I see two lists of questions - <strong>Questions that may already have your answer</strong> and <strong>Similar Questions</strong>. These questions are obviously inspired by the content that I am typing in (title and question), and are pulling from previous questions that were posted on StackExchange. On the site itself, I can filter by questions based on tags, while finding new questions using StackExchange's own full-text search engine. StackExchange is a large company, but even small blogs also provide content recommendations, filtration, and full-text searching. You can imagine even more examples of hard-coded logic within a CRUD webapp that can be used to automate the extraction of valuable information from a knowledge base.</p>

<p>If we have a knowledge base that users can change, and we have an inference engine that is able to use the knowledge base to generate interesting results...is that enough to classify a system as being an ""expert system""? Or is there a fundamental difference between the expert systems and the CRUD webapps?</p>

<p>(This question could be very useful since if CRUD webapps are acting like ""expert systems"", then studying the best practices within ""expert systems"" can help improve user experience.)</p>

1276,1276,,,"<p>In addition to what has already been said about AI, I have the following to add. ""AI"" has had quite a history going all the way back to the original <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Perceptron</a>. Marvin Minsky slammed the Perceptron in 1969 for not being able to solve the XOR problem and anything that was not linearly separable, so ""Artifical Intelligence"" became a dirty word for a while, only to regain interests in the 1980s. During that time, neural nets were revived, backpropagation used to train them was developed, and as computer technology continued its exponential growth, so did ""AI"" and what became possible.</p>

<p>Today, there are lots of things we take for granted which would've been considered ""AI"" 10 or 15 years ago, like speech recognition, for example. I got my starts in ""AI"" speech recognition back in the late 70s where you had to train the voice models to understand a single human speaker. Today, speech recognition is an afterthought with your Google apps, for example, and no a priori training is needed. Yet this technology is not, at least in general audiences, considered ""AI"" anymore.</p>

<p>And so, what would be ""minimum requirements""? That would depend on whom you ask. And what time. It would appear that that term only applies to technology ""on the bleeding edge"". Once it becomes developed and commonplace, it is no longer referred to as AI. This is true even of Neural Nets, which are dominant in data science right now, but are referred to as ""machine learning"".</p>

<hr>

<p>To install the package you can use <code>pip</code> for example:</p>

<pre><code>pip install fuzzywuzzy
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can use it to check the similarity between two strings (100 is the highest score; higher score means more similar):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from fuzzywuzzy import fuzz
&gt;&gt;&gt; fuzz.ratio(""How are you?"", ""How are you?"")
100
&gt;&gt;&gt; fuzz.ratio(""How are you?"", ""How are you doing?"")
80
</code></pre>

<p>Or, which might be most interesting to you, find the most similar string from a list of strings:</p>

<pre><code>from fuzzywuzzy import process
choices = ['HI', 'HELLO', 'HEY', 'GOOD MORNING','TELL ME A JOKE', 'JOKE', 'FUNNY','GIVE ME A TIP', 'TIP', 'LESSON','WHAT IS YOUR NAME', 'WHO ARE YOU', 'HOW ARE YOU?']
</code></pre>

<p>You can get a list of the phrases with the highest score (parameter limit, 2 in this example):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; process.extract(""hello there"", choices, limit=2)
[('HELLO', 90), ('HEY', 60)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; process.extract(""please make a joke"", choices, limit=2)
[('JOKE', 90), ('TELL ME A JOKE', 69)]
</code></pre>

<p>Or just get the one with the highest score:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; process.extractOne(""whoe are you?"", choices)
('WHO ARE YOU', 96)
&gt;&gt;&gt; process.extractOne(""I want a lesson"", choices)
('LESSON', 90)
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note</em>:</p>

<p>There are cases where another phrase might give a relatively high score also:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; fuzz.ratio(""How are you?"", ""Who are you?"")
83
</code></pre>

<p>But as long as you also have ""Who are you"" and ""How are you"" in the list, they will be detected correctly:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; process.extract(""Who are you?"", choices, limit=2)
[('WHO ARE YOU', 100), ('HOW ARE YOU?', 91)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; process.extract(""How are you?"", choices, limit=2)
[('HOW ARE YOU?', 100), ('WHO ARE YOU', 91)]

<p>As with all machine learning, a computer knows only what it's taught.  If an event arises that's unusual, the AI will have less relevant training on how to respond, so its reaction behavior <em>necessarily</em> will be inferior to its routine ""standard operating procedure"", for which is has been heavily trained.  (Of course this is true of humans too.)</p>

<p>Due to liability concerns, when encountering an outlier condition, smart cars will almost certainly be designed by their makers to <em>immediately</em> pull off the road and wait to be explicitly told what to do -- by the human in the car or by communicating with a central command office that exists to disambiguate such confusion and resolve cognitive impasses.  When confused, just like a child, a smart car will be designed to seek external assistance -- and is likely to do so indefinitely, I suspect.</p>

<p>That's why, despite Google's recent cars that lack steering wheels, smart cars most certtainly <em>will</em> retain some means of manual control -- be it a wheel and pedals, or at least verbal commands.  Given the many forms of weirdness that are possible on the road, it's possible smart cars will <em>never</em> be fully autonomous.</p>

<p>As for bad weather conditions, how well do smart cars currently perform?  Nobody outside of a car manufacturer can say for certain.  Lidar and radar are superior to the human eye in seeing through fog and snow.  But (competent) humans are likely to remain better than a smart car at dynamically learning the limit of adhesion and compensating (since this is a learned skill few smart cars will already know or can learn quickly -- given this car, these tires, this road surface, this angle of road, etc).</p>

<p>Initially smart cars will turn to the human when the going gets rough, ceding control back to them.  Once smart cars have driven a few million miles in snow, slush, high wind, floods, and ice, and encountered many ducks, angry mooses, and irate pedestrians, they will have been taught to do more for themselves.  Until then, and perhaps for decades yet, I suspect they will turn to mommy and ask for help.</p>

1289,1289,,,"<p>A new physical lifeform could outperform and replace artificial intelligence when it
has feedback from organism (its body) to its design information (replacement of genes).</p>

<p>This evolution is expected because:</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence will redesign its own software very soon in its evolution.
After that, it will be restricted by the performance of the available hardware
and communication speed between parts.
Therefore it will design better processing hardware for itself, to run its next generation.</p>

<p>To squeeze most processing power out of a given amount of resources (matter, energy) and
circumstances (temperature, radiation) the design has to be small (material resources
and delay of interconnections), energy efficient (heat evacuation), and adapted to the
kind of functions used by the software (hardware architecture).</p>

<p>To tackle this profoundly, artificial intelligence will design the new hardware at
atom by atom scale.
This leads to new problems of natural degradation by radiation, atomic decay and other
quantum-mechanical problems and opportunities.
The solution of these new problems is redundancy and the ability to repair
degraded parts by atomic-level machinery.
This atomic level repair machinery is the same machinery which builds and extends the hardware
for new individual artificial intelligence systems.
Since this feature is there, it can, and will, also be used to restructure parts
of the hardware while it runs to integrate (compile) knowledge in hardware (more efficient).</p>

<p>The machinery to build and maintain such hardware could be inspired by the biological machinery
which will be understood by the system by then.
However, when the artificial intelligence refactors these principles with full understanding
and anticipation, the resulting ""hardware"" will be quite different from the old biological
machinery and very different from the static silicon based processor structures.<br>
The main differences are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The design information will be available, relating the features of the realization
with design choices.
This provides direct feedback from performance of the realization (the hardware, the body)
to the design information.
That augments the design information for designing new generations.
This feedback channel is the main difference between the new machinery and biological life.
Once that exists, it will be used for everything, not only for processing hardware for
artificial intelligence.</p></li>
<li><p>The new design described here is basically processing hardware rather than a body
for fighting and propagating
(although the eternal fight for resources will not end with the dawn of
artificial intelligence).</p></li>
<li><p>It will use more compact molecules because it is designed rather than evolved blindly.
(The current biological life uses monster-molecules evolved by random changes until
one or other corner of the molecule has the right shape to catalyze a specific chemical reaction).</p></li>
<li><p>Since parts of the hardware can be restructured while the system runs, the distinction between
hardware and software will become very fuzzy (as in biology).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The drastic increase in efficiency and evolution speed let it outperform the old biological
life (which lacks design and feedback) and outperform artificial intelligence (which was not
integrated in matter).</p>

<p>When this stage is reached, the systems will look like a natural, intelligent,
propagating life-form and therefore supersede the stage of artificial intelligence
running on human-made processing hardware.</p>

<p>This answers the last part of the question:

<p>""The AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made out of atoms which it can use for something else.""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A different threat lies with the instruction of highly intelligent AI</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here it is useful to consider the paper clip maximiser thought experiment.</p>

<p>A highly intelligent AI instructed to maximise paper clip production might take the following steps to achieve its goal.</p>

<p>1) Achieve an intelligence explosion to make itself superintelligent (this will increase paperclip optimisation efficiency)</p>

<p>2) Wipe out mankind so that it cannot be disabled (that would minimise production and be inefficient)</p>

<p>3) Use Earth's resources (including the planet itself) to build self replicating robots hosting the AI</p>

<p>4) Exponentially spread out across the universe, harvesting planets and stars alike, turning them into materials to build paper clip factories</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Clearly this is not what the human who's business paperclip production it was wanted, however it is the best way to fulfil the AI's instructions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This illustrates how superintelligent and highly intelligent AI systems can be the greatest existential risk mankind may ever face.</p>

<p>Murray Shanahan, in <strong>The Technological Singularity</strong>, even proposed that AI may be the solution to the Fermi paradox: the reason why we see no intelligent life in the universe may be that once a civilisation becomes advanced enough, it will develop an AI that ultimately destroys it.
This is known as the idea of a <strong>cosmic filter</strong>.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the very intelligence that makes AI so useful also makes it extremely dangerous.</p>

<p>Influential figures like Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking have expressed concerns that superintelligent AI is the greatest threat we will ever have to face.</p>

Expressive modalities are how we recognize the operative context from the behaviors of other agents.  For an artificial agent, avoiding un-canniness would involve clustering the factors underlying the classification of discourse contexts, tagging them with corresponding factor models for manner in a way which closely aligned to the classifications which human agents make.  This involves developing an adequate latent representation for both spaces, which is likely to involve quite a lot of training data, or some clever transfer learning in conjunction with one-shot techniques (generally, taking samples as modes).</p>

<p>When the context becomes one of friendship, for example, the style factors of expression should extend to factors of trust, collaboration, disclosure, sympathy.  In order to implement these, layered abstractions in the representation of behaviors will need to be crafted, presumably by training.  In order to align these learned categories to human categories, which I suppose to be essential to emotional fluency, exploiting the structure of corpus semantics - including distributional characteristics of the linguistic labels and inferences - when estimating loss gradients seems a natural strategy, which exploits cultural learning.</p>

1312,1312,,,"<p>I'll attempt to analyze a couple of different perspectives.</p>

<h3>1. It is artificial</h3>

<p>Synonyms: insincere, feigned, false.</p>

<p>There is the idea that any ""intelligence"" created by humanity is not actually intelligent and, by definition, it is not possible. If you look at the structure of the human brain and compare it to anything humans have created thus far, <em>none</em> of the computers come close to the power of the brain. Sure they can hold data, or recognize images, but they cannot do everything the human brain can do as fast as the brain can do it with as little space as the brain occupies.</p>

<p>Hypothetically if a computer <em>could</em> do that, how do we determine its intelligence? The word <em>artificial</em> defines that the intelligence is not sincere or real. This means that even if humanity creates something that appears intelligent, it has simply become more complex. It is a better fake, but it is still fake. Any money not printed by the government is by definition counterfeit. Even if someone finds a way to make an exact duplicate, that doesn't mean that the money is legal tender.</p>

<h3>2. Misuse of power</h3>

<p>If an AI is given rights and chooses to <em>exercise</em> those rights in a way that agrees with its creator's views, possibly through loyalty to its creator, or through hidden motives, then anyone with the capabilities to create such an AI would become extremely powerful by advancing their own beliefs through the creation of more AIs. This might also lead to the <em>ruthless parallelization</em> that you mentioned, but with (even more) selfish goals in mind.</p>

<p>If this were not the case, and an AI could be created to be neutral with free will and <strong>uncontrollable by humans</strong>, then perhaps an AI could be given rights. But I do not believe this would ever be the case. With great power comes great responsibility. Even with free will, a true AI would most likely end up serving humanity, because humans have control of the plugs and the electricity, the Internet, the software, and the hardware. The social implications of this for the AI are not promising. It's not even just the <em>ongoing</em> control of these resources that is the issue. Whoever creates the software and hardware for the AI would have special knowledge. If fine adjustments were made, specific individuals would undoubtedly hold sole control of the AI, as adjustments could be made to the code in such a way that the AI behaves the same except under specific circumstances, and then when something goes wrong (assuming the AI has its own rights), then the AI would be blamed rather than the programmers who were responsible.</p>

<h3>3. Anthropocentrism</h3>

<p>In order for humanity to get away from anthropocentrism, we would have to become less selfish when it comes to <em>humans</em>, first. Until we can solve every existing social problem within humanity, there is no reason to believe that we could cease thinking of humanity as more important than created machines. After all, supposing there were an almighty God that created humanity, wouldn't the humans always be beneath God, never to be equals? We can't fully understand our own biology. If an AI were created, would it be able to understand its makings in the same way its creators would? Being the creator would give humanity a sense of megalomania. I do not think that we would relinquish our dominion over our own technological creations. That is as unlikely to happen as the wealthiest of humanity willingly giving the entirety of their money, power, and assets to the poorest of humanity. Greed prevents it.</p>

<h3>4. Post-human fundamentalism</h3>

<p>Humans worship technology with their attention, their time, and their culture. Some movies show technologically advanced robots suppressing mankind to the point of near-extinction. If this were the case and humanity were in danger of being surpassed by its technology, humanity would not stand idly and watch its extinction at the hands of its creation. Though people may believe superior technology could be created, in the event we reached such a point humanity would fight to prove the opposite, as our survival instincts would take over.</p>

<h3>5. A balance?</h3>

<p>Personally, I do not think the technology itself it actually possible, though people may be deceived into thinking such an accomplishment has been achieved. If the technology were completed, I still think that anthropocentrism will always lead, because if humanity is the creator, humanity will do its best to ensure it retains control of all technological resources, not simply due to fear of being made obsolete, but also because absolute power corrupts absolutely. Humanity does not have a good historical record when it comes to morality. There is always a poor class of people. If wealth were distributed equally, some people would become lazy. There is always injustice somewhere in the world, and until we can fix it (I think we cannot), then we will never be able to handle the creation of true AI. I hope and think that it will never be created.</p>

1315,1315,,,"<h2>Does it benefit us?</h2>

<p>To answer this question, it's worth considering practical reasons why we grant or don't grant other people rights historically and currently.</p>

<p>In essence, this is an arbitrary choice - there certainly were well functioning societies that didn't grant rights to many or most people; and we still don't grant some rights to many people - for example, we deny children the same rights to self-determination that adults have; we consider some people legally incapacitated and allow others to make key decisions for them; and we exclude most people from having a say in 'local' matters, e.g. non-citizens don't get a right to vote.</p>

<p>However, there has been a strong historical trend towards a more inclusive society - granting full(er) rights to non-aristocrats, granting full(er) rights to all races, granting full(er) rights to women. IMHO, and there's lot of space for discussion, this has been driven mostly by two factors:</p>

<p>1) including all the people fully in the society became an economical advantage, as it made them more productive participants in economy, allowing a more inclusive society to advance beyond societies neglecting large parts of their population in e.g. education and participation in skilled jobs;</p>

<p>2) A more egalitarian society is not only more pleasant to live in but more secure, with less conflict and violence - again, giving an advantage to a more inclusive society.</p>

<p>From this position, I'd argue that any realistic prediction about the future rights of intelligent AI (i.e., talking about what likely <em>will</em> happen instead of a theoretical discussion about what <em>should</em> happen) depends on how these two factors apply.</p>

<p>If we believe that the intelligent AI will be constructed so that (1) it's motivation doesn't really depend on it's rights, and it is fully committed to it's ""job"" anyway, and (2) ""full rights"" are orthogonal or even actively not desired by it's goal system, so the situation doesn't raise a risk of ""rebellion"" - then I'd expect that it would not be granted full rights.</p>

<p>If we believe that the intelligent AI will share human-like emotions (e.g. by being the result of ""mind uploading"" or full human brain simulation), then it's likely to eventually be granted full rights because of the same factors why we granted full rights to all the different disenfranchised groups of people.</p>

1320,1320,,,"<p>That's a multifaceted question.  The referenced articles are conjectures much like the hundreds of thousands of other interesting and carefully considered works on the net and in libraries.  Whether any of them bring us down a dark ally or directly toward the objective the question implied is unknown.</p>

<p>The array of common human desires are suggested by derivatives of Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs.  Self awareness is not among them.  From a cognitive science perspective, self awareness is not a desire but rather trait of consciousness.  The plausible explanations for its presence ranges between the extremes of a completely useless artifact of mental evolution to a deliberate infusion from some supreme entity, and everything in between.</p>

<p>The other desires, traits, and capabilities listed in the question are easier to discuss in a way that is backed by existing cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience, and self-evident human experience.</p>

<p>Regulating and prioritizing may an important element in intelligence beyond problem solving.  For instance, a sense of purpose is only a desire as one moves up the hierarchlistedny of needs.  People running from a Mammoth have no interest in purpose.  Regarding competent communication skills, what is and what is not sufficiently competent would require a definition, and not all humans may qualify all of the time.</p>

<p>The sustainable ability to adapt is perhaps a super-set of intelligence in some ways, as in the case of the prioritization that exhibits the hierarchy of needs above and as in the case of DNA based adaptation.  In other cases adaptability may be a subset of intelligence, in the case of applying taught facts and logical deduction to select an optimal choice without the benefit of empirical observation or even trial and error.</p>

<p>The intelligent agent approach may produce something useful, but it is not likely the path that led to a human brain and may not produce anything like it.  We already understand what placing a number of such agents on a problem queue produces.  A time sharing computer is exactly of that architecture.  Parallel computing is not a significant deviation from that model.</p>

<p>None of the current extensions of automation architectures from Bell Labs, Harvard U, MIT, or other historical centers of electronic brain and robotic research and development have produced anything close to the varied integrated capabilities of a biologically healthy, socially aware, motivated human brain functioning as one of the controlling elements within a human body.</p>

<p>We do, however, have machines with human-like capabilities (simulations of task that were once manual), and such devices sometimes out-perform humans. But none of the existing automation is so integrated that they would blend in with humans.  Nonetheless, many already have careers.</p>

<p>Single capability machines with job security:</p>

<ul>
<li>Calculators</li>
<li>Automated hoppers</li>
<li>Anti-aircraft weaponry</li>
<li>Mail sorting machines</li>
<li>Speech recognizing devices</li>
<li>Speech synthesis</li>
</ul>

<p>A general purpose computer, connected to a well designed, high end robot could do any combination of these and other things in a time shared way.  Several networked computers could provide parallel execution of these tasks and even make basic decisions on how to prioritize the various tasks within the computer network.</p>

<p>However, the type of integration of sophisticated translation of arbitrary generalized goals to action leading to success and the imagination and prioritization of such sophisticated objectives is not yet available or at least deployed for general home, commercial, or industrial use.</p>

<p>Some available machines already accomplish well defined goals, but only within a very specific solution domain.  The interaction of various capabilities mentioned is still largely undiscovered at anything close to the level of detail necessary to produce synthetic capabilities of the same caliber.</p>

<p>Whether it is possible to do so, Marvin Minsky voted yes, when he popularized his colleague's characterization of the human brain as a meat machine.  Whether consciousness transcends neural electro-chemistry has yet to be proven or disproved in either the mathematical sense or the laboratory sense of the term Proof.</p>

<p>Interestingly, a form of self-consciousness, some layer of it, seems to require the ability to make a noise and hear it.  Another layer beyond that seems to require the ability to move a muscle and view the results in a reflection.  These and others form an interesting set of phenomena.</p>

<p>Perhaps intelligence requires embodiment.  One of the episodes of Sarah Conner Chronicles implied this, and the theory is an old one recognized independently by several researchers.  The question author implied this vaguely self-evident reality in the mention of action in the question.</p>

There's a <a href=""http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/1877/why-is-searching-important-in-ais"">question</a> on this website regarding this topic, but one could also intuitively understand why. I've had an introductory course on AI, which lasted half of a semester, so of course there wasn't time enough to cover all topics of AI, but I was expecting to learn some theory behind AI (I've heard about ""agents""), but what I actually learned was basically a few searching algorithms, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>BFS</li>
<li>Uniform-cost search</li>
<li>DFS</li>
<li>Iterative-deepening search</li>
<li>Bidirectional search</li>
</ul>

<p>these searching algorithms are usually categorised as ""blind"" (or ""uninformed""), because they do not consider any information regarding the remaining path to the goal. </p>

<p>Or algorithms like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Heuristic search</li>
<li>Best-first search</li>
<li>A</li>
<li>A*</li>
<li>IDA*</li>
</ul>

<p>which usually fall under the category of ""informed"" search algorithms, because they use some information (i.e. ""heuristics"" or ""estimates"") about the remaining path to the goal.</p>

<p>Then we also learned ""advanced"" searching algorithms (specifically applied to TSP problem). These algorithms are either constructive (e.g., NN), local search (e.g., 2-opt) algorithms or meta-heuristic ones (e.g., ACS, SA, etc).</p>

<p>We also studied briefly a min-max algorithm applied to games and an ""improved"" version of the min-max, i.e. the alpha-beta pruning.</p>

<p>After this course I didn't remain with the feeling that AI is more than searching, either ""stupidily"" or ""more intelligently"".</p>

<li><p>What's more than ""searching"" in AI that could be taught in an introductory course?

<ul>
<li>Object recognition &amp; scene building (e.g. the process of taking
audio-visual input of your surroundings and understanding it in a 3D
and contextual sense) can be treated as searching for known objects
in the input.</li>
<li>Mathematical problem solving can be treated as searching for a solution.</li>
<li>Playing a video game can be treated as searching for the correct response to a given gamestate.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even rudimentary chatbots can be characterized as finding the 'correct' response to a given input phrase to emulate human language!</p>

<p>Because of this generalization of search, search algorithms were among some of the first algorithms considered 'AI', and often form the basis of many AI teaching courses. On top of this search algorithms are intuitive and non-mathematical, which makes the somewhat terrifying field of AI accessible. This might sound like hyperbole, but I guarantee that if your lecturer had opened with Manifold Learning Techniques half of your class would have bolted for the door by the time they mentioned 'eigenvalue of the covariance matrix'.</p>

<p>Now search algorithms aren't the only way to address these problems. I recommend every AI practitioner is familiar with the notion of Data Science and Machine Learning Algorithms. ML is often related to search algorithms but the techniques they use can vary heavily from iterative building of a classifier/regression (e.g. C4.5 builds a decision tree), meta-heuristics as you noted, and classifiers/regression that are statically generated from analysis of training data (e.g. Naive Bayesian is literally a classifier built on Bayesian analysis of the given data assuming that input fields are independent - this is the 'naivety' from which it gets its name). Often ML algorithms are developed in AI research groups and can sometimes be designed for specific problems instead of being general form algorithms. In contrast to the general field of AI, which is often centered on Intelligence problems and is therefore (in my view) vulnerable to too much blue sky thinking, ML is applied to all sorts of real life problems and is often very practical in its design and performance driven in its evaluation.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, assuming we can build AI, there is no reason it would be impossible build an AI that has the potential to get stuck in a computational loop and become non-functional. You can imagine a recurrent neural network where the continuous state inside the ANN dominates its behavior causing it to reproduce states with small variety (as input will always be relevant in a connected ANN) but are converged around a particular state space. Whether that is akin to death is a philosophical question for your own peace of mind.</p>

  <p>If I turned right 90 degrees and then rotated my motors forward for 3s, my front bump-sensor activates.</p>

1339,1339,,,"<h2>Nonhuman ethics can be totally arbitrary</h2>

<p>Regarding your citation, perhaps it's useful to consider why should anything that philosophers have said about human ethics apply for arbitrary nonhuman systems? We all share a common biological background, our behavior, emotions and especially positive/negative feelings arise from the particular way how our brains are built. Man is by nature a social animal, and much of our behavior and feelings of empathy, compassion, fairness, greed, social status, etc are formed and expressed in society. Our minds are adjusted for this, as are the minds of other mammals. A human that forms an ethical system when joining a civil society does so in the basis of all this shared context, and within the limitations of it.</p>

<p>However, all this is orthogonal to intelligence. All the variety of mankind encompasses a tiny island in the whole space of possible intelligences and their goals. Any system of ethics is feasible, a vast majority of them having no relationship whatsoever to what we could consider ethical. A human can be expected to join a society and learn ethics because our brain is hardwired to respond to social stimuli - an AI would learn ethics from a society only if its previous ethics already happen to value that highly, and that isn't likely to happen without careful design.</p>

<p>There is a thought experiment that is commonly used as an example - the ""paperclip maximizer"", an artificial agent with an ethical system that defines 'good' proportionally to the number of paperclips that exist in the universe and only that - and that is a <em>perfectly reasonable</em> example, because a completely random ethical system is overwhelmingly likely to reduce to something stupid like that. The space of ""reasonable"" (to us) ethical systems is very tiny compared to all ethical systems possible, and expecting that a randomly selected ethical system will just happen to land there is like relying on winning a high-stakes lottery.</p>

<h2>We want their ethics to contain certain things</h2>

<p>So the main reason why we are studying AGI ethics is because we (or some of us) really, really, want the AGI ethical system to include certain things. For example, I'd like that ethical system to include my survival. I'd prefer that ethical system to be consistent with my happiness and wellbeing - and the very existence of a very powerful entity that simply happens to not care about me at all is not compatible with my survival and wellbeing, so I'd <em>really</em> prefer for it to care about me, or alternatively never become very powerful.</p>

<p>One could certainly argue that we have no right to constitute ethics, rules and morale for another society which could be much more intelligent and better than us. That another society might be ""better"" in some manner - but better <em>for whom</em> ? If it's better for ""them"" but worse for me (and humanity), then I have strong motivation to simply <em>claim</em> that right and try my hardest to ensure that this hypothetical future society includes me, my desires and my ethics. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The neuropsychologist Donald Hebb postulated in 1949 how biological
  neurons learn:</p>
  
  <p>“When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite a cell B and
  repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth
  process or metabolic change takes place on one or both cells such that
  A’s efficiency as one of the cells firing B, is increased.”</p>
  
  <p>In more familiar terminology, that can be stated as the Hebbian
  Learning rule:</p>
  
  <p>If two neurons on either side of a synapse (connection) are activated
  simultaneously (i.e. synchronously), then the strength of that synapse
  is selectively increased.</p>

<p>There is definitely a problem (a curse if you will) when the dimensionality of a task (MDP) grows. For fun, lets extend your problem to a much harder case, continuous variables, and see how we deal with it.</p>

<pre><code>Mood: range [-1, 1]   // 1 is Happy, 0 is Neutral, -1 is Sad

Hunger: range [0, 1]  // 0 is Very Hungry, 1 is Full

Food: range [0, 100] // amount of food, capping at 100 for numbers sake

Time of day: [0, 23] // Hours, 9.5 would be 9:30 am

Position x: range [-10, 10] // assuming the area the agent stays in is 10x10 km

Position y: range [-10, 10]

Money: range [0, 2000]
</code></pre>

<p>Now its impossible to even count the number of states the agent could be in. An example of one state would be:</p>

<pre><code>Mood, Hunger, Food, Time, PosX, PosY, Money
.5, .3, 67.4, 4.5, 0, 0, 5
</code></pre>

<p>This would mean that our agent has a neutral mood, is kind of hungry, has 67.4% food, the time is 4:30 am, they are in the center of the city (0,0), and have 5 dollars. Which has happened to me once or twice before too so this is reasonable. <strong>If we we still wanted to generate a transition matrix and a reward matrix we would have to represent this state uniquely from other possibly similar states such as if the time was 5 pm with all other things equal.</strong></p>

<p>So now how would we approach this?
First lets discretize or breakup each range into little chunks. Then we could have an array of 0s representing our chunks and assign a 1 to the index of the chunk we are in. Lets call this array our feature array. 
If we did this for each dimension of our state information, we would end up with some state similar to what you originally proposed. I've chosen some arbitrary numbers to break up the state space and lets see what it does to the example state.</p>

<p>If we broke the Mood range up into 8 chunks of .25 we would have these ranges:</p>

<p>m = Mood</p>

<ol>
<li><p>-1.0 ≤ m &lt; -.75</p></li>
<li><p>-.75 ≤ m &lt; -.50</p></li>
<li><p>-.50 ≤ m &lt; -.25</p></li>
<li><p>-.25 ≤ m &lt; 0.0</p></li>
<li><p>0.0 ≤ m &lt; .25</p></li>
<li><p>.25 ≤ m &lt; .50</p></li>
<li><p>.50 ≤ m &lt; .75</p></li>
<li><p>.75 ≤ m &lt; 1.0</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If we took the mood from the example state (.5), it would land in the 7th range, so then our feature vector for mood would look like:</p>

<pre><code>[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0] &lt;- represents a mood of .5
</code></pre>

<p>Lets do the same for hunger by splitting it into 8 chunks of .125:</p>

<pre><code>[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0] &lt;- represents a hunger of .3
</code></pre>

<p>We could then do something similar for each other state variable and break each state variable's range up into 8 chunks of equal sizes as well. Then after calculating their feature vectors, we would concatenate them all together and have a feature vector that is 56 elements long (7 state variables * 8 chunks each).</p>

<p>Although this would give us 2^56 different combinations of feature vectors, it actually doesn't represent what we wanted to represent. We need features that activate (are 1) when events happen together. We need a feature that is 1 when we are hungry <strong>AND</strong> when we have food. We could do this by doing a cross product of our 56 element feature vector with itself.</p>

<p>Now we have a 3136 element feature vector that has features like:
  1 if its 3pm and am happy
  1 if am full and out of food
  1 if at coordinate -3, 4 (Position x, Position y)</p>

<p>This is a step in the right direction but still isn't enough to represent or original example state. So lets keep going with the cross products!</p>

<p>If we do 6 cross products we would have 30,840,979,456 features and only 1 of them would be on when our agent has a neutral mood, is kind of hungry, has 67.4% food, the time is 4:30 am, they are in the center of the city (0,0), and have 5 dollars.</p>

<p>At this point you are probably like ""Well.. thats a bit much"", to which I would agree. This would be the curse of dimensionality, and is the reason transition tables stop being fun (if they ever were).</p>

<p><strong>Instead lets take a different approach</strong>, rather than trying to represent an individual state with an individual feature and saying whether that feature is good, lets go back to our nice 56 element feature vector. From here lets instead give a weight (w_i) to each of our 56 features. We have now entered the world of linear function approximation. Although I could explain it here, I think its better explained in Chapter 9 of the Introduction of Reinforcement Learning. <a href=""https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/bookdraft2016sep.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/bookdraft2016sep.pdf</a></p>

<p>Now Rationale :</p>

<p>(Y.a&lt;0) </p>

<p>This means 
Either of the following :</p>

<ul>
<li>Y=-1 and a>0 ; in this case the target output is -1 but as a>0 so the Perceptron outputs 1. So we must move the weight vector away from this set of input vector, so that angle between them increases and the dot product (a) becomes &lt; 0 so that we can get the target output.
Hence : <strong>W</strong>=<strong>W</strong>-<strong>X</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Or ,<strong>W</strong>=<strong>W</strong> + (-1)<strong>*X</strong>
Or, <strong>W</strong>=<strong>W</strong>+Y<strong>X</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Y=1 and a&lt;0</li>
</ul>

<p>This means the target output is 1 but as the activation is &lt;0 so Perceptron is outputting -1. So we must move the weight vector close to this set of input vector so that the activation can become >0 (angle decreases) and the Perceptron can output the desired output.
So :
<strong>W</strong> = <strong>W</strong>+<strong>X</strong>
Or <strong>W</strong>=<strong>W</strong> + Y<strong>X</strong></p>

<p>Again , Y.a=0 is a boundary case.
By now I think you can understand the rationale behind Y.a=0. If any doubt , comment to this answer , I will explain it.</p>

<p>The place where AI and/or machine learning tools may be best used is in the conversion of non-CSS styling to CSS styling.  Once they are in that form, the copying and layering of styling becomes trivial.</p>

<p>To convert a legacy web site to proper CSS style sheet use, the input would be a set of all documents likely to be involved in the styling of a specific page (i.e. its style dependencies).

<p>The greatest usability could be obtained by adding some automation to these refactoring transformations, as in Maxima simplification functions like trigsimp.  This is a typical search of options, perhaps with predictive branching, as in compiler optimizations.</p>

<p>Training could be accomplished through use of an array of input document sets and the careful scoring of transformations and/or outputs of trials could be performed with a software engineer with appropriate expertise in AI and/or machine learning, in conjunction with a CSS expert or a focus group containing two or more of them.</p>

<p>Once this process and the resulting rule set works, it would then be possible to simplify the CSS further by finding styling redundancy across pages and doing transformations that reduce an entire site to a minimal set of style sheets and style specifications within them.</p>

1367,1367,,,"<p><strong>Semantics Matters</strong></p>

<p>The answer depends on how you define intelligence.  If you define intelligence as the ability to adapt, a number of things could be considered intelligent that don't normally fit under the classic AI umbrella.</p>

<ul>
<li>Nonlinear least-squares Marquardt-Levenberg curve fitting algorithm with a finite set of models and automated model trials, outcome analysis, and smart decisioning</li>
<li>Check reader software recently deployed in bank branches and offices</li>
<li>The combination of medical providers, patients, and carriers and the modification of treatment through financial instrumentation to improve outcomes</li>
</ul>

<p>If you define intelligence as mimicking the abilities of the human mind that facilitate adaptation across a wide array of arbitrary domains that had not been previously experienced or studied, then no such system is yet available to the public.  Nothing even close.</p>

<p>If such a system exists in secrecy, someone would have to violate their nondisclosure agreement or security clearance to tell us about it here.</p>

<p>The definition of intelligence is central to answering.  For instance, some reasonable definitions of intelligence might lead an unbiased judge to rate ants above humans.  Ants had been building in hexagons for millennia before humans blundered into the habit of building in rectangles.  Rectangles require over 70% more building material to build vertical structure per square foot of floor space than a packed hexagonal structure.</p>

<p><strong>Basic Artificial Intelligence System Requirements</strong></p>

<p>Guessing that by, ""Basic AI,"" you mean some naive machine learning, there are a few basic components.  (The term Naive in this context means that the AI does not understand the domain or the meanings of symbols or signals it is processing in the way a human who had studied or worked within the field might understand them.)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>SENSING &mdash; The machine (computer) must receive information, generally as a time series.  In human beings, these are the senses.  In a mail sorter, it may be a camera.  This is beyond just the concept of input in information technology.  It is more analogous to an input signal in a PID controller.  In an automated high speed trading machine, this would be the high speed version of a ticker tape.</p></li>
<li><p>CONTROL &mdash; The machine must manipulate externals in a way that exploits the received information.  In a basketball player, this is the motor coordination, facial affect, verbal signals to teammates, and perhaps some verbal bait for opposing players.  In a mail sorter, this would be the motor control of mail direction.</p></li>
<li><p>MEMORY &mdash; The machine must have storage to audit input time series (perhaps from some transducer in the real world or some data store upon which some intelligent analysis or transformation must be done).  In more advanced systems, the machine may wish to analyze its own performance and make adjustments that converge on some optimal metric value (perhaps a historical maxima or minima) or some range of acceptability.</p></li>
<li><p>FEEDBACK &mdash; The machine must interpret some feedback signalling or use a predetermined scoring mechanism.  Learning cannot occur in an information vacuum, so some definition of better or worse must be established.  The feedback may be entangled within the SENSING channels or may arrive through a completely separate channel. In biological systems, these are often pre-wired as threat detection, pain, and pleasure.  The cerebral cortex uses concepts of goals and progress.  In some ways, child rearing and social strata exists to teach the boundaries of what constitutes an acceptable goal and acceptable methods for making progress toward it.</p></li>
<li><p>MODELLING &mdash; Whether implicitly or explicitly, some model must be developed and exploited.  Some would say that the existence of a model upon which the predictive capabilities of it can be applied to decision making to achieve some goal or weighted collection of goals is intelligence.  Others would say that the development of the model is intelligence and the use of it is merely control mechanics.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Approaches to Simulating Human Thinking</strong></p>

<p>Cognition is not the only form of model making, but the creation of cognitions and their application to decision making.  The concept of intelligence may have been furthered along a realistic path by Roger Schank, who proposed that the storage and indexing of stories was a primary characteristics of what humans recognize as intelligent conversation.</p>

<p>Minsky and others took a direction that was more connected with logical inference work that began with logic formalization (originally George Boole) and Church's lambda calculus.</p>

<p><strong>Some Common Directions in Design</strong></p>

<p>The genetic algorithm influenced convergent technology and neuro-biology influenced neural net development.  Pattern matching is another limb off the larger set of technical approaches under the umbrella of classic Artificial Intelligence.</p>

<p>These are naive systems.  Like a neuron, the components have no idea of the meaning of what they are processing.  They are naive components.  An intelligent observer could not ascertain the real time meanings of signals and symbols between these naive components without extensive, perhaps life-long research.</p>

<p>Naive Bayesian methods are probabilistic in nature.  They exploit Bayes' Theorem, and have been found to produce excellent results in certain important domains.  Some studies have shown that naivety is actually a learning accelerant, which is interesting from an AI theory point of view.</p>

<p>Then there is fuzzy (weighted) logic, which was an attempt to merge neural nets with production (rule based) systems.  Attempts to use this technology in transportation routing and scheduling has met much success.</p>

<p>There are as many devices and architectures that attempt to effectively integrate or interconnect these various approaches as there are AI projects.</p>

<p><strong>Modelling Environment and Goal Conditions</strong></p>

<p>All of these systems, in some explicit or implicit way, model the external environment and the desired result of system behavior and attempt to converge (in real time) on that result.  Some sense-control functionality, which may change and adapt to the external environment is employed in the CONTROL component(s).</p>

<p>This is just another way that the systems have an adaptive behavior.  Without necessarily knowing why, the system will manipulate what it can and continue to monitor the state of the environment to continually reach for the system's acceptance criteria.</p>

<p>The Basic AI system must to more than learn.  It must also judge its own functionality and therefore must have a layer of feedback and control that simulates the perception of optimality.  This higher level control must be integrated into the system at its inception for it to behave intelligently in the sense you probably mean.</p>

<p><strong>Understanding Limitation and System Complexity</strong></p>

<p>The more sophisticated and adaptive the modelling becomes, the more the cognitions, rules, stories, time series coefficients, weights, or whatever forms knowledge (not information) is stored, the more one can say that there is some form of understanding or comprehension.</p>

<p>One conjecture is that it is the recursion in layers of these capabilities that permits certain types of comprehension and awareness.  Other conjectures focus more on alertness and attention as keys to higher intelligence.</p>

<p>But these much more mature capabilities are beyond mere adaptation based on past knowledge or information and are therefore beyond what you probably meant by Basic AI.</p>

""Cognitive architectures"" would probably also fall here, so things like ACT-R, SOAR, CLARION, etc.  And then you have automated planning systems, automated theorem provers, etc.  Skills needed to work here include a good handle on logic - probably first order logic, but possibly higher order logics as well.  Set theory, model theory, things of that nature come into play.  Lisp, Prolog, or OPS5 might be commonly used programming languages.    </p>

<p>In the area of ""probabilistic learning"" are things like neural networks, bayesian belief networks, and other ""machine learning"" algorithms.  Random forests, decision trees and what-not are usually lumped in here as well.  Skills needed to work in this area include some calculus (backpropagation in neural networks, for example, is heavily rooted in the chain rule from calculus), linear algebra, statistics and probability.  Bayesian statistics is especially useful.  Lots of programming languages are used to build these kinds of systems, but popular ones include Python, C++, R, Java and their ilk.</p>

<p>Then you have a few things that don't classify real neatly.  Genetic Algorithms, for example.  Those usually get put into machine learning, but GA's are really more of an optimization strategy.  So you might, for example, use GA's as part of a strategy for training an ANN.  </p>

<p>Ethical responsibility between humans is based on a sympathetic correspondence between humans. Between humans and robots, if one party lacks the desire or capability to sympathize with the other party, no ethical responsibility exists.</p>

<p>In this way, conservative anthropomorphism applies.</p>

<p>However, there is also axis of capability that I think is required in order to warrant human-like 'emancipation' for robots, which is not necessarily anthropomorphic. For lack of a better term, I call this an Arbitrary Machine Generator (AMG). At a species level, extant biological life is an AMG - capable of slowly evolving to solve arbitrary problems, assuming the resources and solutions are available. At an individual level, pre-human animals are not capable of generating arbitrary machines to solve arbitrary problems on individual time-scales. Only humans (and post-humans) are capable of generating arbitrary machines in order to solve arbitrary problems, given the resources and solutions available. Humans can search the space of all possible (resource constrained) solutions.</p>

<p>So, for a robot to ""deserve"" the freedom to define it's own purpose, it must first have <em>access</em> to the space of all possible (within the constraints of available resources) purposes. It then must have purposes and internal contexts of such sufficient complexity and familiarity that we humans are capable of sympathizing with those purposes and internal contexts.</p>

<p>If either of those are not present - the AMG criteria and the sympathetic contexts - then emancipation is not warranted.</p>

From the paper:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Artificial Agent <em>A</em>, designed by <em>H</em>, passes LT if and only if</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p><em>A</em> outputs <em>o</em>,</p></li>
  <li><p><em>A</em> outputting <em>o</em> is not the result of a fluke hardware error, but rather the result of processes <em>A</em> can repeat</p></li>
  <li><p><em>H</em> (or someone who knows what <em>H</em> knows, and has <em>H</em>'s resources) cannot explain how <em>A</em> produced <em>o</em>.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The authors of the original Lovelace Test then argues that it is impossible to imagine a human developing a machine to create an artifact...while also not knowing how that machine worked. For example, an AI that uses machine learning to make a creative artifact <em>o</em> is obviously being 'trained' on a dataset and is using some sort of algorithm to be able to make predictions on this dataset. Therefore, the human <em>can</em> explain how the AI produced <em>o</em>, and therefore the AI is not creative.</p>

<p>The Lovelace Test seems like an effective thought experiment, even though it appears to be utterly useless as an actual test (which is why the <a href=""http://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/1451/has-the-lovelace-test-2-0-been-successfully-used-in-an-academic-setting"">the Lovelace Test 2.0 was invented</a>).

<p>Most in the fields of adaptive systems, machine learning, machine vision, intelligent control, robotics, and business intelligence, in the corporations and universities in which I've worked do not discuss this topic much in meetings or at lunch.  Most are too busy building things that must work by some deadline to muse over things that are not of immediate concern, and bot-rights are a long way off.</p>

<p><strong>How Far Off?</strong></p>

<p>To begin with, no bot has yet passed a properly conducted Turing Test. (There is much on the net about this test, including critique of poorly conducted testing of this type.  See Searle's Chinese Room thought experiment.)</p>

<p>Language simulation with semantic understanding is difficult enough without adding creativity, coordination, feelings, intuition, body language, learning of entirely new domains from scratch, and the potential of genius.</p>

<p>In synopsis, we a long way from the procurement of bots that simulate humanity sufficiently to be considered for citizenship, even in a progressive country that abhors fundamentalism of any kind.  No actual imbuement of rights will occur until we have bot-citizenship in one or more countries.  Consider that human fetuses do not yet have rights because they are not yet deemed citizens.</p>

<p><strong>Relevance of the Answer for Today</strong></p>

<p>In current culture, conservative anthropocentricm and post-human fundamentalism arrive at the same effective conclusion, and that may continue to be the case for a hundred years.</p>

<p>Those with experience across fields of psychology, neuro-biology, cybernetics, and adaptive systems know that the simulation of all the mental features we attribute to humans is to copy in algorithms the layering of cerebral abilities over a reptilian brain that went through millions of years of field testing.</p>

<p><strong>Impact of Science Fiction</strong></p>

<p>Asking around, it is likely you would get some feedback that is mostly gained from the media of our culture, not philosophic theses and publications written by those who don't actually have any deadlines to produce anything that functions IRL.</p>

<p>Isaac Asimov investigated some conservative anthropomorphism concepts in scenarios depicted in his short stories.  Commander Data's human quirks in the Next Generation Star Trek teleplays furthered some of those ideas.</p>

<p>Christopher Nolan took the opposite direction in the Interstellar screenplay, with the robots having interesting personalities that could be altered by linear settings.  His bots ignored concerns of self-preservation, apparently without any cognitive resistance.  This depiction is an unapologetic post-human fundamentalist view.</p>

<p><strong>A Thought Experiment</strong></p>

<p>Let's place the citizen issue aside for to consider this thought experiment, and let's assume that a survey would show a leaning toward conservative anthropocentrism among current AI researchers.</p>

<p>Consider an intelligent piece of software constructed a legal complaint to gain intellectual property rights over day trading code it wrote and sent it to the appropriate court clerk, you might find that the same researchers would recant.  </p>

<p>Post-human fundamentalism will probably prevail when real AI software theorists and engineers consider the true personal, corporate, and meaning of settling out of court or losing the case.</p>

While the problem is more natural, perhaps, for a Convolutional or Recurrent Neural Network, there's no problem to try and run this on a feed forward network. However, the way you give letters as input will be very confusing for a network and will make learning very hard. I'd recommend using one hot encoding or even a binary encoding for the letters. If this is for more than playing around I'd try and add some info (encode whether the letter is in ""aeiou"" in a separate bit).</p>

<p>As for the hidden layers, try playing around a bit. Two systematic approaches are to start very simple and make the model more complicated, or start complicated and make your model simpler (or just normalize a lot). Look at the performance on the training set and on a separate validation set during training. If the model keeps on improving on the training data but starts to deteriorate on the validation data, you're probably over fitting. In this case you should either make the model simpler (fewer nodes, fewer layers) or regularize (start with l2 normalization on the weights). If the data doesn't perform well on the training data, you may wish to make the model more complex.</p>

<p>One thing that came to mind last night is a system that takes an image of a movie poster and predicts the genre of the movie. I think I have a good understanding of what'd be required to do this (put together a dataset, augment it, download a convnet trained on imagenet, finetune it on my dataset, and go from there).</p>

<p>I also thought that it would be pretty cool to run the system backwards at the end, so that I could put in e.g. a genre like 'horror' and have the system generate a horror movie poster. I expect that it will be very bad at this because I'm not a team of expert researchers, but I think I could have some fun hacking on it even if it only ever generated incomprehensible results.</p>

<p>Here's what I'm having trouble understanding: on the one hand, all the convnets whose architecture I've seen described seem to rely on being given very small, square input images (on the order of 220px by 220px iirc), and movie posters are rectangular, and a generated poster would have to be of a larger size in order for a human to make any sense of it.  I've seen several examples of papers where researchers use convnets to generate images, e.g. the adversarial system that generates pictures of birds and flowers, and a system that generates the next few frames of video when given a feed of a camera sweeping across the interior of a room, but all of those generated images seemed to be of the small square size I've been describing.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I've seen lots of ""deep dream"" images over the past year or so that have been generated by convnets and are of a much larger size than ~220px by ~220px.</p>

<p>Here's my question: is it possible for me to build the system I describe, which takes a movie genre and outputs a movie poster of a size like e.g. 400px by 600px? [I'm not asking about whether or not the resulting poster would be any <em>good</em> - I'm curious about whether or not it's possible to use a convnet to generate an image of that size.]</p>

<p>For the latter, if you want large images then GANs are indeed the way to go. Currently the largest images we can generate are on the order of 220 x 220 pixels, mostly due to memory constraints on the GPU. There is no fundamental problem with having rectangular images, it just so happens that we use squares. You would be able to use identical architectures to train on rectangular data as well.</p>

<p>The reason that some generated images you see (e.g. from DeepDream or NeuralStyle) are larger is that it's not a GAN. Both of these are not generative models in a standard sense, even if they do technically ""generate"" images. Instead, they merely modify an existing image by running backprop on a specifically designed loss function.</p>

1408,1408,,0.0,"<p>I'm thinking about a probability-based AI for the card game 31. In the game, the players are dealt 3 cards each; you need not know all the rules.</p>

<p>Let's say the scenario is Bob vs the AI (there are only two players). It would be quite simple for the AI to know what the probability that Bob has 3H (3 of hearts): it is either 0 (the AI has the card), or 3 out of the 49 remaining cards = 6.1%.</p>

<p>In 31, a turn consists of picking up a card and discarding a card. The goal is to get the highest sum of cards of one suit. Therefore it would be bad strategy at all times to discard a 5H when you has a 3H in your hand. To make the AI robust, I would say that Bob follows this strategy with probability 95%.</p>

<p>Suppose Bob discards a 5H. How can the AI calculate the probability that Bob had a 3H in his hand?</p>

<p>My goal is to be able to use all of the plays by other players in conjunction with good strategies to create a picture for the AI of what cards other players are likely to have or not have.</p>

<h3>My thoughts so far</h3>

<p>Bayes' Law is <code>P(b|a) = P(a|b)P(b)/P(a)</code> which in this case would be</p>

<pre><code>P(Has 3H | Played 5H) = P(Played 5H | Has 3H)P(Has 3H)/P(Played 5H)
</code></pre>

<p>We know that <code>P(Played 5H | Has 3H)</code> is 95%, but the other two probabilities are unclear to me, especially <code>P(Played 5H)</code>.</p>

<p>I think I may be going the complete wrong direction by trying bayesian stuff. A Bayesian network wouldn't work because nothing in the deck of cards is conditionally independent of each other, and so the network would be intractable.</p>

<h3>A more general question</h3>

<p>I want to be able to answer more questions beyond this simple query. What I really want is to be able to calculate the probabilites for each card being in the stock pile, Bob's hand, the AI's hand, or any other player's hand. I think it might possibly be intractable, but I also feel like it should be possible.</p>

1412,1412,,,"<p>I don't see anything wrong in the generated code.
Let me explain:</p>

<p>In the following block, we define that 70% of the data will be used for training the network, 15% for the validation, and 15% for the testing:</p>

<pre><code>net.divideParam.trainRatio = 70/100;
net.divideParam.valRatio = 15/100;
net.divideParam.testRatio = 15/100;
</code></pre>

<p>Then the network is trained from the inputs/targets passed as arguments. Note that here, all inputs are given at once for efficiency. The separation training/validation/testing is done inside the <code>net</code> function from the proportions passed in the <code>net</code> input argument (through the <code>net.divideParam.XRatio</code> properties).</p>

<pre><code>% Train the Network
[net,tr] = train(net,inputs,targets);
</code></pre>

<p>Then we test the results of the network on the data without discrimination between training/validation/testing. This performance score should be higher than the ""real"" performance score of the net as the performance over the training data should be higher than the one over the validation/testing data.</p>

<pre><code>% Test the Network
outputs = net(inputs);  % Compute predictions from the inputs
errors = gsubtract(targets,outputs);  % Compare the predictions to the targets (true values)
performance = perform(net,targets,outputs)  % Built-in Matlab function giving an overall performance score
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we know how the net performs overall, we can look at how it performs on the training, validation, and testing sets, respectively. The masks are created as an output of the <code>net</code> function, from the proportions given in the first block of code. The output have been already all computed when the <code>net</code> function has been called.</p>

<pre><code>% Recalculate Training, Validation and Test Performance
trainTargets = targets .* tr.trainMask{1}; % Apply a mask (0's and 1's to select the proper targets)
valTargets = targets .* tr.valMask{1}; % idem
testTargets = targets .* tr.testMask{1}; % idem

trainPerformance = perform(net,trainTargets,outputs); % Compute a score for the training data
valPerformance = perform(net,valTargets,outputs); % same for the validation data
testPerformance = perform(net,testTargets,outputs); % same for the test data
</code></pre>

<p>I think your code does the exact same thing but in more steps, with multiple calls to the <code>net</code> function and without using its native way of working (you define the proportions of training/validation/testing by hand for instance without making use of the <code>net.divideParam.Xratio</code> property). So it is probably not optimal from the computational point of view. </p>

So this is where you should have your data split into say a 80/20 training and validation set.  And if data is scarce or you want that 20% to contribute to the model then you could do a 5 fold cross validation.</p>

<p>When a human is intelligent, the human will repeatedly achieve goals even when varied challenges appear along the path to the goal.  The human adapts the way a localized collection of organisms within a species adapt to environmental changes over generations, but the human mind adapts quickly by eliminating approaches (solution ideas) instead of eliminating individuals within the collection of organisms.</p>

<p>The term Artificial Intelligence was intended to mean intelligence designed or programmed into a machine by humans.  If the design of intelligence into a machine is possible, then it is likely that the mind is (as some have suggested) merely a biological machine.  Therefore, applying the same definition of Artificial Intelligence, a student taught by a text book and some lectures must also be artificial.  Education would be a set of capabilities programmed into a biological machine by humans.</p>

<p>Either way, the modifier ARTIFICIAL is meaningless.  The presumption that humans (or machines) could act intelligently without literacy and education is pure fantasy.  Such is a denial of the complex and gradual ascent of civilized thought.</p>

However, through hyperparameter optimization and some newly invented approaches, these have been overcome for my scenarios. From my own experiments:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dropout seems to be a very good regularization method (also a pseudo-ensembler?),</li>
<li>Batch normalization eases training and keeps signal strength consistent across many layers.</li>
<li>Adadelta consistently reaches very good optimas</li>

I realize that there are countless other methods, and that SVM's can be considered a sub-class of NN's, but still.</p>

<p>So, to my question:</p>

<p><strong><em>With all the newer methods researched for neural networks, have they slowly - or will they - become ""superior"" to other methods? Neural networks have their disadvantages, as do others, but with all the new methods, have these disadvantages been mitigated to a state of insignificance?</em></strong></p>

<p>I realize that oftentimes ""less is more"" in terms of model complexity, but that too can be architected for neural networks. The idea of ""no free lunch"" forbids us to assume that one approach always will reign superior. It's just that my own experiments - along with countless papers on awesome performances from various NN's - indicate that there might be, at the least, a very cheap lunch.</p>

Evaluation of a trained deep NN can be much more expensive than competing techniques too.</li>
<li>The effort involved in learning how to architect and train a NN is still much higher than competing methods, like an SVM. People who are just starting out in Data Science should probably use other techniques to learn about the nuances of fitting data before getting involved in neural networks. And although simple NNs with only one or two hyperparameters are often available in 
many data science libraries, they don't perform any better than other techniques so are just another ML black-box technique really.</li>
<li>While we have made a lot of progress in understanding how neural networks do their magic, they are still less accessible and dissectible than most competing methods. So while NNs might solve the problem, they might not give you as many insights as easily as other techniques do.</li>

<p>In that research paper, researchers were able to program the robots to follow a planning simulation to reduce the probability of abuse by children. If it detects children, the robot is programmed to retreat into a crowd of adults (who can then discipline the children if needed). This happened because the researchers saw that it was only children who were beating up the robots in the mall in question.</p>

<p>They discuss trying out other options though:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this work the robot’s strategy to prevent abuse was to “escape”, i.e. move to a location where it is less likely abuse will occur. One could ask why the robot cannot overcome the abuse. In our preliminary trials we have tried several approaches, but we found that it is very difficult for the robot to persuade children not to abuse it. For example, we changed the robot’s wordings in many ways, using strong words, emotional or polite expressions, but none of them were successful. One partially successful strategy was the robot ‘physically’ pushing children. When its way was blocked, it would just try to keep going and behave as if it will collide into children and force its way through (under careful monitoring from a human operator). We observed that children at first accepted the robot’s requests and obeyed them; but, very soon they learned that they are stronger than the robot so they can win if they push, and also that they can stop it by pushing the bumper switch (attached on the robot for safety). After realizing that, they just continued with the abusive behavior. Obviously having a stronger robot would present a problem for safety and social acceptance so dealing with such abusive situations remains difficult.</p>

After all, one could argue that the machine won't really 'experience' pain if you torture it...so it should be morally okay to torture the machine then. It may be respond as <em>if</em> it is in pain, but it's dubious whether the ability to simulate an emotional state such as ""being in pain"" is equivalent to actually <em>being</em> in that emotional state. See the question <a href=""http://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/34779/is-the-simulation-of-emotional-states-equivalent-to-actually-experiencing-emotio/35815"">Is the simulation of emotional states equivalent to actually experiencing emotion?</a> for more discussion on this topic.</p>

<p>You can make such an argument, but it won't really work on an emotional level because most humans would feel <em>empathy</em> towards the machine. It may be hard to justify it logically (and it may be based on humans' tendencies to engage in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">anthropomorphism</a>), but we feel this empathy. It's this empathy that caused you to ask this question in the first place, caused researchers to figure out how to protect a robot from being beaten up, enabled police officers to <a href=""http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/09/07/national/crime-legal/drunken-kanagawa-man-60-arrested-after-kicking-softbank-robot-in-fit-of-rage/#.WHj4Rccc9Lp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">arrest a drunken Japanese man for beating up a SoftBank robot</a>, and made many humans upset over the destruction of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HitchBOT"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hitchBOT</a>. And <em>that's</em> how AI abuse would be avoided - human empathy. If most humans care about the welfare of machines, they'll make it a priority to stop those few humans who are able and willing to abuse the machines.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: The OP has edited his <em>question</em> to clarify that he is talking about <em>software</em>, and not about robots. For robots, you can rely on anthropomorphism to produce some level of sympathy, but it's hard to sympathize with raw lines of code.</p>

<p>You're not going to stop abuse of algorithms. Put it frankly, since the algorithms aren't like us, we aren't going to extend the same sort of empathy that we would to robots. Even chatbots are kinda iffy. If you could get people to sympathize with lines of code though (possibly by making a convincing simulation of emotion and sapience), then the above answer applies - humans anthropomorphize the machine and will come up with countermeasures. We aren't that level yet, so ""stopping AI abuse"" will be a low priority.</p>

<p>Still, some failsafes could be programmed in to limit the damage of abuse, as detailed in <a href=""https://www.chatbots.org/ai_zone/viewthread/1488/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this thread on chatbot abuse</a> - making the bot respond in a boring manner to make the abuser feel bored and move onto the next target, responding back to the abuser in a ""battle of wits"", or even just blocking the abusers from using the service.</p>

<p>These failsafes are cold comfort to those that want to <em>prevent</em> abuse, not respond to it. </p>

<p>Also...an abuser can happily learn how to program an AI to then abuse to his/her heart's content. Nothing can be done to stop that, and any possible measures to stop said abuse (such as monitoring every human being to make sure they don't program an AI to abuse) will probably cause more damage than it'd solve.</p>

One of the major problems with A.I. programmers is that they are always trying to push computers to do things which are designed for ""mature"" intelligent creatures who have prior experience and knowledge of solving problems.  -As if these things can be imputed without the A.I. having to achieve the necessary and vital ""learn by trial and error"" experience first. For example: when allowing for task examination; self evaluation and risk assessment.</p>

<p>You have answered your own question, because these things can only be gained by ""experience"". However, the only way to surmount this is to expose a prototype A.I. to the main problems; help it to solve them, and then to take its memory and use it as a template for other A.I's.  </p>

<p>Technically, AI's which have learned to solve prior problems could make their memories available to others on demand, so that an inexperienced AI could solve an issue without having achieved the skills needed.</p>

<p>However, I would like to add that mimicking intelligence is not in itself ""intelligence"". Many programmers fall into the trap of believing that to emulate something is qualitatively the same expression as the genuine article. This is a fallacy which infers that we only have to simulate intelligence without understanding the real mechanisms which create it. </p>

<p><strong>No, there is also a bit of misunderstanding of bidirectional search:</strong> In bidirectional search you run <strong>2</strong> simultaneous searches, one forward from the initial state, and another one backwards from the goal(hoping they meet in the middle and save you steps), if actions are reversible ( going from node to node), the successor nodes become predecessors in one search and vice versa, and your goal becomes your initial state, in your case:</p>

<p>Intelligence is a term that primarily applies behaviors - people, animals or artificial systems can be called intelligent iff they exhibit intelligent behavior or decisions.</p>

<p>While there are many definitions of intelligence - here's <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.3639"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a paper that studies 70 of them</a> - it can be summarized to something like ""Intelligence measures an agent’s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments."" (S. Legg and M. Hutter).</p>

<p>Perhaps this definition is the answer to your implied question - while many algorithms can be very effective (often literally superhuman) in their own narrow domain, as of now they are very restricted in the range of environments where they exhibit this effectiveness. This means that they are not fully intelligent, they don't meet the definition/requirements of intelligence, and this also matches our intuitive expectations - we don't call AlphaGo superintelligent, because while it can beat humans in Go, the same humans can beat the same system on pretty much every other task.</p>

<p>However, a <em>truly sufficiently</em> advanced algorithm that <em>can</em> be effective at all or most varied tasks (e.g. a <em>general</em> artificial intelligence) can be reasonably called intelligent in the full meaning of the word.</p>

<li><p>Games: Games also use AI to learn the game with the aim of winning the game when played against a human or an AI player. You must have played lots of games on mobile and PC like Chess, Tic-Tac-Toe, etc. You play against the computer and according to the difficulty value set, the computer plays its moves. This difficulty value is nothing but the ability of the AI engine to predict the next moves by the opponent.</p></li>
<li><p>Chatbots: There have been lots of development and improvements in Chatbots, so that humans can communicate with them as if they are talking to other human. There are many chatbots designed which answer any question asked by us (of course it is dependent on how much intelligence the bot holds). Some examples are <a href=""http://alice.pandorabots.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ALICE</a> bot, <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/watson/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IBM Watson</a> (which has been the most advanced bot till now).</p></li>

<p>For example: If one looks at these problems from an academic position, the problems will always seem insurmountable. This is because everything is coldly assessed and calculated in isolation to everything else.</p>

<p>The answer predominantly lies in <strong><em>word association</em></strong>. You have to write a program that can process a vast database of digital books, to register every word and all the words in that language which are associated with it. Plus all the statistical information with each associated word and its associated punctuation. </p>

<li>Whether the structure of a given sentence is correct.</li>
<li>If the structure is bad, what the probability is for determining the context and intent of what is being said.</li>

I mean not to collect the big data to a central place but instead to do the training from local data on the user's hardware (in a distributed way). The result if this would be lots of trained NNs that would in the end be merged into one in a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_machine"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Committee of machines</a> (CoM) way. Would such model be possible?</p>

<p>Of course the above stated model does have a significant drawback - one does not have control over the data that is used for learning (users could intentionally submit wrong/fake data that would lower the quality of the final CoM). This may be dealt with by sending random data samples to the central community server for review however.</p>

<p>Example: Think of a powerful smartphone using its camera to capture a road from vehicle's dashboard and using it for training lane detection. Every user would do the training himself/herself (possibly including any manual work like input image classification for supervised learning etc.).</p>

<p>I wonder it he model proposed above may be viable. Or is there a better model how to use crowdsourcing (user community) to deal with machine learning?</p>

<p>It's worth noting that detection of particular phrases or commands is considered a distinct problem, different from text to speech / text transcription.</p>

But inevitably some translations are not optimal or just flat-out incorrect. I am wondering if there is some way of ""correcting"" the model when it makes mistakes while not compromising the desirable behavior on translations where it previously performed well. </p>

<p>As an experiment, I took a model that I had previously trained and gathered several examples of translations where it performed poorly. I then took those examples and put them into their own small training set where I provided more desirable translations than what the model was outputting. I then trained the old model on this new small training set very briefly (3-6 training steps was all it took to ""learn"" the new material). When I tested the new model it translated those several examples in the exact way I had specified. But as I should have anticipated the model overcompensated to ""memorize"" those handful of new examples  and thus I noticed it started to perform poorly on translations that it had previously been excellent. </p>

<p>Is there some way to avoid this behavior short of simply retraining the model from scratch on an updated data set? I think I understand intuitively that the nature of neural networks would not lend itself to small precise corrections (i.e. when the weighting of just a few neurons change the performance of the entire model will change) but maybe there is a way around it, perhaps with some type of hybrid reinforcement learning approach. </p>

1478,1478,,,"<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> First of all, you state that that the goal G2 will be found first by relying on the expansion order <code>R, B, D, G2</code>.</p>

<p>This is wrong. It is extremely easy to see that this is wrong, because A* is a search algorithm that guarantees to find an optimal solution given that only admissible heuristics are used. (A heuristic is being admissible if it never over-estimates the optimal goal distance. This is the case in your example.) Since the true cost for reaching G1 is 11 and the true cost for reaching G2 is 13, clearly G1 must be found first.</p>

<p>Thus, your expansion order is wrong as well. Let us first give the f-values for all nodes:
<code>f(A)=11, f(B)=10, f(C)=11, f(D)=13</code></p>

<p>Assuming that h(G1)=h(G2)=0 (i.e, the heuristic is ""goal-aware""), we get <code>f(G1)=11</code> and <code>f(G2)=13</code>.</p>

<p>Because A* expands search nodes by lowest f-values of the search nodes in the open list (the search nodes not yet expanded), we get the following expansion order:
<code>R, B, A, C, G1</code></p>

<p>You very-likely did a mistake that is done extremely often: after heaving expanded D, you add G2 to the open list. Because G1 is a goal node and you are already ""seeing"" it, you return it as a solution. But this is wrong! Goal nodes are <em>not</em> returned when being created, but when being selected for expansion! So, although the expansion of D generates G2, you are not allowed to return G2 as solution, because it has not been selected for expansion.</p>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong>
Can G2 be found as well?</p>

<p>As <em>NietzscheanAI</em> pointed out, you can simple continue search. That is, after heaving expanded  <code>R, B, A, C, G1</code>, A* will expand <code>D, G2</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Hint</strong>: when implementing your idea of artificial life, you should consider that each cell/organism have to have some kind of <em>sensors</em> in order to capture informations from the environment; such informations i.e. the position and the distance of the nearest meal and/or predators, the temperature, the pressure and depth of water, should be passed through the neural network to determine the response of the cell. Also, in your environment you should promote the spreading of organisms which responses are euristically better i.e. cells that don't get caught by predators or don't die by starvation. How? Simply by evolving their brain/brains/sensors through a genetic algorithm that favors individuals/species with good parameters. I recommend you a nature-inspired AI method, it is called NEAT model.

<p>A possible approach might be the one suggested and studied by J.Pitrat (one of the earliest AI researcher in France, his PhD on AI was published in the early 1960s and he is now a retired scientist). Read his <a href=""http://bootstrappingartificialintelligence.fr/WordPress3/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bootstrapping Artificial Intelligence blog</a> and his <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/book/10.1002/9780470611791"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Artificial Beings: the conscience of a conscious machine</a> book.</p>

<p><sup>(I'm not able to summarize his ideas in a few words, even if I do know J.Pitrat -and even meet him once in a while- ; grossly speaking, he has a strong meta-knowledge approach combined with reflexive programming techniques. He is working -alone- since more than 30 years on his CAIA system, which is very difficult to understand, because even while he does publish his system as a free software pragram, CAIA is  not user friendly, with a poorly documented common line user interface; while I am enthusiastic about his work, I am unable to explore his system.)</sup></p>

<p>But defining what ""conscience"" or ""self-awareness"" could <em>precisely</em> mean for some artificial intelligence system is a hard problem by itself. AFAIU, even for human intelligence, we don't exactly know what that <em>really means</em> and how does that <em>exactly</em> work. IMHO, there is <em>no consensus</em> on some <em>definition</em> of ""conscience"", ""self-awareness"", ""self-examination"" (even when applied to humans).</p>

<p><br><br>Turing Test revolves around the left side of the cardinality, which is mostly concerned with how humans think or act. But, we know that this is just not all. Turing Test has not much to offer when it comes to what AI is in a general sense.<br>
Turing Test, as the Wikipedia states, was created to test machines exhibiting behaviour equivalent or indistinguishable from that of a human. Artificial Intelligence is much more than what humans can do or how they act. There are many human acts that are considered unintelligent and sometimes inhuman too.<br>
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chinese Room Argument</a> focuses on something every important when it comes to <strong>""Consciousness v/s Simulation of Consciousness""</strong>. John Searle argued there that it is possible for a machine (or human) to follow a huge number of predefined rules (algorithm), in order to complete the task, without thinking or possessing the mind. Weak AIs are good at simulating the ability to understand but, don't really understand what they are doing. They don't exhibit <strong>""Self-Awareness""</strong> and don't form representation about themselves. <strong>""I want that v/s I know I want that""</strong> are two different things.<br><br>
As Theory of Mind states that a good AI should not just form representation about the world it is working on, but also about other agents and entities in the world. This two concepts of <em>self-awareness and theory of mind</em> draw a thin line between weak and strong AI.<br><br>
When it comes to the Turing Test, it fails on many grounds and so does the Total Turing Test, which adds another layer to the test. Most of the researchers believe that Turing Test is just a distraction from the main goal, something that hinders them from fruitful work. Consider this, suppose you ask a difficult arithmetic problem in order to distinguish between human and machine. If the machine wants to pretend it is human then it will lie. This is not what we want. Going for the Turing Test sets the upper bound to the AI that can be created. Also making AI act and behave like humans is not a very good idea. Humans are not very good at making right decisions all the time. This is the reasons why we read about wars in our history books. Decisions which we make are often biased, have selfish origins, etc. We don't want an AI to come with all those things.<br><br>
I don't think there is one test to test an AI. This is because AI has many definitions, many types. Whether an AI is weak or strong can be tagged while looking for answers to questions like, ""I want that v/s I know I want that"", ""Who am I and what exactly I am doing (from machine's perspective)"", plus some other questions I mentioned above.<br><br></p>

1510,1510,,,"<p><strong>Why would one professor only teach searching algorithms in AI course? What are the advantages/disadvantages?</strong></p>

<p>My answer to this question is that there are lots of problems where the solution can be found using searching. Take an example of Tic Tac Toe. If you are designing an intelligent computer player for this, then what you will do is that you will form a search space and then you will search for most optimal move which can be made to conclude the game. In these, scenarios you must be aware of optimal search strategies. Let's take another example, suppose if you are driving and want to got to an unknown person's house. It's far from your place and you decide to use GPS. Your GPS will use search algorithms to find the most optimal route that you can take to reach to the destination (of course there will be lots of factors to consider like traffic, etc. but this is the basic idea).</p>

<p>Disadvantages are only in terms of processing and storage. For slow algorithms you will be wasting lots of CPU time and storage as well but for good and efficient algorithms, you can preserve lots of space and also execute your task very fast. Of course, just learning about searching isn't AI. There's lot more to it.</p>

<p><strong>What's more than ""searching"" in AI that could be taught in an introductory course?</strong></p>

<p>There is lots of things in AI other than searching. For example, learning techniques (supervised, unsupervised, reinforced), planning when one wants to design a system that will do certain actions independently and intelligently, representation of knowledge (known and unknown) and inference in agents which includes propositional logic and first-order logic, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Are there theories behind AI that could be taught in this kind of course?</strong> </p>

<p>Instead of directly communicating with the AI , we would instead communicate with a messenger, who would relay our communications to the AI. The messenger would have no power to alter the AI's hardware or software in any way, or to  communicate with anything or anyone, except relaying communications to and from the AI and humans asking questions. The messenger could be human, of a software bot The primary job (and only reason) of the AI would be to act as a filter, not relaying any requests for release back, only the answer to the question asked. The ethics of this method are another debate. </p>

<p>The AI would have to be physically isolated from all outside contact, other than 8 light sensors, and 8 LEDs.

Through this system, the two parties could communicate via flashes of light, and since there are 8, the flashes would signal characters in Unicode. </p>

<p>My guess is the following. In the proof given in Sutton and Barto, the expectation is unrolled in time.

1542,1542,,,"<p>How could self-driving cars make ethical decisions about who to kill?</p>

<p><strong>By managing legal liability and consumer safety.</strong></p>

<p>A car that offers the consumer safety is going to be a car that is bought by said consumers. Companies do not want to be liable for killing their customers nor do they want to sell a product that gets the user in legal predicaments. Legal liability and consumer safety are the same issue when looked at from the perspective of ""cost to consumer"".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And here are few dilemmas:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Does the algorithm recognize the difference between a human being and
  an animal?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>If an animal/human cannot be legally avoided (and car is in legal right - if its not then something else is wrong with the AI's decision making), it likely won't. If the car can safely avoid the obstacle, the AI could reasonably be seen to make this decision, ie. swerve to another lane on an open highway. Notice there is an emphasis on liability and driver safety.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Does the size of the human being or animal matter?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Only the risk factor from hitting the obstacle. Hitting a hippo might be less desirable than hitting the ditch. Hitting a dog is likely more desirable than wrecking the customer's automobile.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Does it count how many passengers it has vs. people in the front?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It counts the people as passengers to see if the car-pooling lane can be taken. It counts the people in front as a risk factor in case of collision.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Does it ""know"" when babies/children are on board?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>No.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Does it take into the account the age (e.g. killing the older first)?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>No. This is simply the wrong abstraction to make a decision, how could this be weighted into choosing the right course of action to reduce risk factor? If Option 1 is hit young guy with 20% chance of significant occupant damage and no legal liability and Option 2 is hit old guy with 21% chance of significant occupant damage and no legal liability, then what philosopher can convince even just 1 person of the just and equitable weights to make a decision?</p>

<p>Thankfully, the best decision a lot of the time is to hit the breaks to reduce speed (especially when you consider that it is often valuable to act predictably so that pedestrians and motorists can react accordingly). In the meantime, better value improvements can be made in terms of predicting when drivers will make bad decisions and when other actions (such as hitting the reverse) are more beneficial than hitting the breaks. At this point, it is not worth it to even begin collecting the information to make the ethical decisions proposed by philosophers. Thus, this issue is over-hyped by sensational journalists and philosophers.</p>

<p>the distinction between biological and ""artificial"" life blurred. If you think about it, <em>what exactly is ""life"", anyway?</em> <strong>A set of complex systems with emergent behavior capable of evolution and adaptation.</strong></p>

<p>A prototypical biologist may not define life that way. Indeed, he would, <em>not</em> being focused or concerned with the computational aspect, define it in a way that would narrow it down to biological life.</p>

<p>Marvin Minsky mention the concept of <em>luggage words</em>, and I myself came up with the notion of <em>mirage concepts</em>. For the former, that which we don't understand gets lump into the word. For the latter, when you take a ""mysterious"" concept apart, it vanishes like a mirage does as you get closer.</p>

<p>So <em>what is life</em>? If we look at a ""living"" organism, we'd all that ""life"". If we remove a single cell from that organism, we'd still call that ""life"". But what if we remove a single organelle like, say, a ribosome? Lysosome? Contractile vacuole? Endoplasmic reticulum? Is that still ""life""? What if we remove a macromolecule from that? Is that still ""life""?</p>

<p>As you see, all becomes <em>very</em> murky, and I do this on purpose to illustrate just how <em>arbitrary</em> the very concept of ""life"" is.</p>

<p>So I think my definition is a good one, broad enough to encompass both in-silico and the organic versions. It bespeaks to algorithms, robots, viruses -- yes <em>both</em> computer and organic... anything that has <em>complexity</em> and the ability to <em>adapt</em> and <em>evolve</em>. </p>

<p>Generally, a (NLIDB) question answering system contains two components: question analysis and answer retrieval. Given an input question, the question analysis component produces key terms, question class/category and the structure of the input question, for example: [QuestionPhrase: Which universities] [Relation: are] [NounPhrase: Knowledge Media Institute]] [Relation: collaborating with].</p>

<p>Taking the output of the question analysis component as input, the answer retrieval component firstly generates an concrete query expression in a database query language (e.g SQL query). Then the concrete (SQL) query is used to find an answer in a target database. Here in an intermediate process, you might want to use semantic lexicons such as WordNet to map the extracted key terms (e.g. concepts or relations) to the database concepts such as table names or columns.</p>

From Word Embeddings To Document Distances</p>

<pre><code>&gt; We present the Word Mover’s Distance (WMD), a  novel 
&gt; distance  function  between  text  documents.   Our  work  is  based
&gt; on  recent  results  in word embeddings that learn semantically mean-
&gt; ingful  representations  for  words  from  local  co-occurrences  in 
&gt; sentences.   The  WMD  distance measures the dissimilarity between two
&gt; text documents as the minimum amount of distance that the  embedded 
&gt; words  of  one  document  need  to “travel” to reach the embedded
&gt; words of another document. We show that this distance metric can be
&gt; cast as an instance of the Earth Mover’s Distance, a well studied
&gt; transportation problem for which several highly efficient solvers have
&gt; been developed.   Our metric has no hyperparameters and is
&gt; straight-forward to implement. Further, we demonstrate on eight real
&gt; world document classification data sets, in comparison with seven
&gt; state- of-the-art baselines, that the WMD metric leads to
&gt; unprecedented low k-nearest neighbor document classification error
&gt; rates.

I've read as much as I can on the subject (that I can grasp) and believe I understand all the broad concepts and some of the workings (despite being very weak in maths), neurons, synapses, weights, cost functions, backpropagation etc. However, I've not been able to figure out how to translate real world problems into a neural network solution. </p>

<p>Case in point, Adam Geitgey gives as an example usage, a house price prediction system where given a data set containing <strong>No. of bedrooms</strong>, <strong>Sq. feet</strong>, <strong>Neighborhood</strong> and <strong>Sale price</strong> you can train a neural network to be able to predict the price of a house. However he stops short of actually implementing a possible solution in code. The closest he gets, by way of an example, is basic a function demonstrating how you'd implement weights:</p>

<pre><code>def estimate_house_sales_price(num_of_bedrooms, sqft, neighborhood):
  price = 0

  # a little pinch of this
  price += num_of_bedrooms * 1.0

  # and a big pinch of that
  price += sqft * 1.0

  # maybe a handful of this
  price += neighborhood * 1.0

  # and finally, just a little extra salt for good measure
  price += 1.0

  return price 
</code></pre>

<p>Other resources seem to focus more heavily on the maths and the only basic code example I could find that I understand (i.e. that isn't some all singing, all dancing image classification codebase) is an implementation that trains a neural network to be an XOR gate that deals only in 1's and 0's.  </p>

<p>So there's a gap in my knowledge that I just can't seem to bridge. If we return to the <strong>house price prediction</strong> problem, hows does one make the data suitable for feeding into a neural network? For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>No. of bedrooms: 3</li>
<li>Sq. feet: 2000</li>
<li>Neighborhood: Normaltown</li>
<li>Sale price: $250,000</li>
</ul>

<p>Can you just feed <strong>3</strong> and <strong>2000</strong> directly into the neural network because they are numbers? Or do you need to transform them into something else? Similarly what about the <strong>Normaltown</strong> value, that's a string, how do you go about translating it into a value a neural network can understand? Can you just pick a number, like an index, so long as it's consistent throughout the data?</p>

<p>Most of the neural network examples I've seen the numbers passing between layers are either 0 to 1 or -1 to 1. So at the end of processing, how do you transform the output value to something usable like <strong>$185,000</strong>?</p>

<p>I know the house price prediction example probably isn't a particularly useful problem given that it's been massively oversimplified to just three data points. But I just feel that if I could get over this hurdle and write an extremely basic app that trains using pseudo real-life data and spits out a pseudo real-life answer than I'll have broken the back of it and be able to kick on and delve further into machine learning.</p>

Some of the more advanced methods are described <a href=""https://www.cs.ccu.edu.tw/~wylin/BA/Fusion_of_Biometrics_II.ppt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Note: I will assume that you are using f(x) = tanh(x) as your activation function. If you aren't, you should still be able to reason through how to normalize your data after reading this.</em></p>

<p><strong>How to prepare the input data:</strong></p>

<p>The basic idea is that you want a significant variation in each input parameter to be reflected by a significant variation in the activation of the neuron those inputs are being fed into. By looking at a plot of the derivative of the tanh(x) actiavtion function, you'll see that the region of significant slope is within a distance of one or two from the origin. This means that whether the input to the activation function is 2000 or 3000 (values of x for which the derivative is negligibly small), the output of the activation will be almost identical...so your neuron's state will be independent of the difference between 2000 and 3000, and your network will never produce any predictive power from values in that range. </p>

<p>So if you want to input the square footage of the house into a neuron, you need to <em>normalize</em> the square footage so that the network can tell the difference between 2000 and 3000. One way to do this so that all of the significant variations in your data are 'noticed' by the neuron is to <strong>z-score-normalize the inputs</strong>. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Gather all of your square footage values (from your training set) and calculate the mean and standard deviation. <em>Store the mean and standard deviation</em>---you'll need this information to normalize new square footage values when testing. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Normalize the vector of square footage values by subtracting the mean and then dividing the result by the standard deviation</strong> (all operations element-wise of course). Subtracting the mean centers your data at the origin, and dividing by the standard deviation makes sure most of it is between -1 and 1, where the neuron's output is most sensitive to its input. This is called z-score normalization because each input value is replaced by its <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">z-score</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do the above for each input variable.</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, when you put each input value through a neuron, the output of the neuron is an activation between -1 and 1 (look at the image of tanh(x)). Since this is already in the 'sensitive' range of the activation function, you don't need to worry about altering the output of the input-layer neurons before sending them to the first hidden layer. Just <strong>give any hidden layer neurons the outputs of the previous layer directly</strong>---they will be able to handle them just fine. </p>

<p><strong>When you reach the last layer (the output neuron(s)), what you get is again another activation between -1 and 1. You have to convert this back into a value for the house in question</strong>, whether that value will be used as a prediction in a test set or to calculate error during training. However you do this, you just have to be consistent and use the same de-normalization procedure in training and testing. One way to think about it is: when the output neuron(s) returns 1, that means the network is returning the <em>maximum possible house value</em> as its prediction. <em>What should the highest value the network can estimate be?</em> The right approach here simply depends on your application. This is what I did:</p>

<ul>
<li>Calculate the mean of [the/each] output variable and store it.</li>
<li>Calculate the maximum deviation of the output variable from the mean. 
Python: <code>MaxDev = max([abs(DataPoint-numpy.mean(TrainingData)) for DataPoint in TrainingData])</code></li>
<li>When the network returns output(s) between -1 and 1, multiply the output by <code>MaxDev</code> and add it to the mean.</li>
</ul>

<p>Two basic quick checks you can do to see if your normalization-renormalization scheme is suitable (these are necessary, but perhaps not sufficient conditions):</p>

<ol>
<li>If all the input values are average (e.g. average no. of bedrooms, average sq.feet, etc), is the network's output equal to the average of the output variable (e.g. house value) as well? (It should be.)</li>
<li>If all the input values are unusually high/low, is the network's output unusually high/low as well? (This only works if all the inputs are positively related to the output...if some of them are inversely related related, you will have to think a bit more).</li>
</ol>

<p>Observe that the scheme presented here satisfies these two conditions.</p>

<p>Notice that this scheme would allow your network to only predict house values <em>inside</em> the range of house values in your training data set. Depending on the application, this behavior can be desirable or undesirable.</p>

<p>For example: you may want to make it impossible for your network to predict negative house values. Think about how you would do this. De-normalize the output so that -1 is mapped to 0.</p>

<p>If you want to set no limit on the values your network can predict, then you can run the network's output through a function that maps the [-1,1] range to all real numbers...like arctanh(x)! As long as you do this during training your network will adjust its weights to accommodate this.</p>

<p>I hope this was helpful. Let me know if you have further questions. My ANN module is in Python, by the way, so I might have language-specific advice.</p>

1571,1571,,,"<p>First, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pascal</a> is not a logic programming language. Logic programming refers to languages like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Prolog</a> where you have a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">declarative</a> style of programming compared to a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">imperative</a> style like you have in Pascal. Maybe you mean <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(computer_programming)#If.E2.80.93then.28.E2.80.93else.29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">if-statements</a> which are typical for imperative languages.</p>

<p>Second, representation means a certain level of abstraction. For instance, a model represents a certain part of the reality. Imagine a cup on a table. If the agent has a representation of this situation, it has a symbol <code>table</code> and a symbol <code>cup</code> which represents the things in the real world. Now it can have a relation <code>on(cup, table)</code> which represents the situation that the cup is on the table. This type of abstraction can be easily represented in a logic language like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(computer_programming)#If.E2.80.93then.28.E2.80.93else.29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">first order logic</a>. Therefore, one uses logic programming languages like Prolog or other types of languages like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OWL</a> to represent knowledge and perform reasoning. So the important term to which Brooks refers is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Knowledge Representation and Reasoning</a>.</p>

<p>Third, if your agent only have sensor data like video or sonar data, then it knows only distances or pixels from the real world. That is not meant with representation. Brooks' Creatures have only this information and calculate with this data directly to perform an action without reasoning. In that sense also artificial neural networks have no representation.</p>

<p>Finally, for an open source project to understand representation I would recommend the above mentioned OWL. You can look at the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prot%C3%A9g%C3%A9_(software)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Protégé</a> editor for working with OWL.

1572,1572,,,"<p>Well,lets get this clear;</p>

<p>Intelligent vision and geostalt processing,both these two terms are in the scope of computer vision.So here I would like to give a glimpse of what computer vision is,inline with artificial intelligence;simply because computer vision is broad when it comes to application;robot vision under this you can check it here as well;Image Processing,Machine Vision and Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning!</p>

<ul>
<li>Computer Vision[The general Term]</li>
</ul>

<p>Let me call it parent;<em>hint:</em> Humans use their eyes and their brains to see and visually sense the world around them. Computer vision is the science that aims to give a similar, if not better, capability to a machine or computer/software program[intelligent Agent].</p>

<p>Computer vision is concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images. It involves the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding.</p>

<ul>
<li>Robot Vision &amp; Machine Vision(intelligent vision)</li>
</ul>

<p>Robot Vision involves using a combination of camera hardware and computer algorithms to allow robots to process visual data from the world. For example, your system could have a 2D camera which detects an object for the robot to pick up. A more complex example might be to use a 3D stereo camera to guide a robot to mount wheels onto a moving vehicle.Just like Google's self driving Car. And remember robot vision is closely related to Machine Vision(though Machine Vision refers to the industrial use of vision for automatic inspection, process control).
Without Robot Vision, your robot is essentially blind. This is not a problem for many robotic tasks, but for some applications Robot Vision is useful or even essential.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning</li>
</ul>

<p>Where it starts to get a little more complex is when we include Pattern Recognition into the family tree, or more broadly Machine Learning. This branch of the family is focused on recognising patterns in data, which is quite important for many of the more advanced functions required of Robot Vision. For example, to be able to recognise an object from its image, the software must be able to detect if the object it sees is similar to previous objects. Machine Learning, therefore, is another parent of Computer Vision alongside Signal Processing/image processing.</p>

<p>However, not all Computer Vision techniques require Machine Learning. You can also use Machine Learning on signals which are not images. In practice, the two domains are often combined like this: Computer Vision technique can detect features and information from an image, which are then used as an input to the Machine Learning algorithms. For example, Computer Vision technique detects the size and color of parts on a conveyor belt, then Machine Learning decides if those parts are faulty based on its learned knowledge about what a good part should look like.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Are such methods/techniques being used or worked on today?</strong> </p>

<p>Jeff Dean, Google Senior Fellow and head of Brain team that just put <a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TensorFlow</a> machine learning library into open source, gave the opening day keynote on deep learning, a powerful class of machine learning that allows machines to understand what they are seeing. These algorithms are trained by exposing them to huge amounts of data.</p>

<p>For example. 1000’s of tagged pictures of a car or people or animals, so they learn to recognize an unknown similar image very accurately, even if the object is somewhat obscured. They are now even able to interpret context. It’s not just a picture of a “baby”, but the algorithm comes back with “A baby is asleep next to a teddy bear”. it's therefore,quite impressive.</p>

<p><em>So,according to such scenario;you can analyse critically and guess what technique is applied! and real progress is made on this;don't forget that these are millions invested in these projects.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Gestalt Processing,inline with it's application(research with progress)</li>
</ul>

<p>Advertisers are using the basic gestalt process in the television medium focus on how the viewer responds to the entire message for instance the sounds, colors and distinct images seen in the commercial. The response varies from viewer to viewer, depending on age, emotional background, physical condition, level of education and social class. How the individual responds is his gestalt. Depending on the product or service, advertisers target the message to specific viewer demographics, who share common gestalt responses.</p>

<ol>
<li>Similarity Principle</li>
</ol>

<p>When conducting an ad campaign, marketers use the gestalt processing when reducing the product to a basic design theme, logo or slogan. Think of famous ad lines or instantly-recognizable symbols, such as McDonald's golden arches. That symbol evokes hamburgers and french fries to anyone remotely familiar with advertising, although the logo itself does not display food. Advertisers strive for individuality when marketing products, so the viewer or customer doesn't confuse their product with a competitor's item. However, under gestalt principles, customers won't confuse completely different products, such as cars and food, or clothes and electronics.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Perception</li>
</ol>

<p>In advertising, perception is reality. Advertisers using gestalt principles must consider how the message they use is perceived by potential customers and how this message prompts action -- buying the product or service. Media and advertising professionals use gestalt theory to create effective ways to sell products whether using images or conceiving of the most beneficial forms of distribution. Figuring the overall success rate of using gestalt principles is also based in simplicity -- sales results.</p>

<p>Therefore;according to such scenario,companies like Amazoon,IBM,Google to mention but a few a have applied all the above methods or techniques and are still booming.</p>

The Reinforcement Learning had no prior model of behaviour and the participants no prior knowledge that their task was to move to and stay in a specific place. The participants were placed in a virtual environment where they had to avoid collisions with virtual projectiles.

For the moment being I'm okay if anyone point me to the right direction.</p>

<p>I wrote the algorithm as specified in the paper in C++ programming languaje (I also downloaded several other implementations from internet for comparation purpouses) and used the very same parameters as specified in the paper (a random steep of 0.2, an initial light intensity of 1.0 and a light decay coefficient of 1.0, a population size of 40). I used the two bright update ecuations given and  for De Jung test function (as for example) a number of dimensions of 256 in a search domain in [-5.12, 5.12] as refered in common optimization literature and in paper.</p>

<p>In the paper the algorithm converges very quickly, as can be expected since this is a very simple test function, however, neither my implementation nor any code I have downloaded converges with that parameters.</p>

<p>My final questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Am I doing something wrong with the experimental methodology or am I using wrong parameter settings (may be something different than the original paper)?</p></li>
<li><p>Do anyone knows where can I find a code sample of Firefly Algorithm that I can use to reproduce the experiments of the mentioned paper?</p></li>

1588,1588,,,"<p>The underlying problem is combinatorial, as you note, but I'm not getting how you're ascribing value to words.</p>

<p>The key element of deciding line breaks, beyond the visual, is rhythmic. <em>(There are other factors, as Bob Salita notes, but you've gotta start somewhere.)</em>  </p>

<p>It seems to me you need to teach the computer how to scan a phrase in the poetic sense, which relates to rhythm.  This is obviously a very difficult task, but the number of syllables and stresses is fundamental numerical data of poetry.</p>

<p>In order to validate to human tastes, you'd then have to use a captcha crowdsourcing method, for both the rhythmic stresses as input, and getting human reactions to different line-break configurations.  You would then reinforce the positive reactions, and the AI would tailor the line-break process to the audience.</p>

<p>However, instead of utilizing human tastes and aesthetic sensibilities, you could instead let the AI decide what is preferred, which would probably be comprised of some sort of symmetry considered optimal to an algorithm.</p>

<p>Following this logic, you wouldn't even need to have the AI learn the stresses, instead just focusing on raw syllables, or, numeric representation based on any factor. (With this method, the object is not to reformat poetry for humans, but for machines :)  </p>

<p>This is more about the aesthetics, but Cameron Browne's <a href=""http://www.cameronius.com/games/shibumi/browne-elegance-5.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Elegance in Game Design</a> would seem to suggest there are engineering solutions to the type of aesthetic issues at the root of your problem.</p>

<p>I might start by teaching it to count the syllables of the poem, then having it look at the divisors. If it's roughly 10, it might be iambic pentameter. The AI doesn't care about the label, but it likes 10.  </p>

<p>20 syllables might represent a couplet in that meter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The time is out of joint, oh cursed spite</p>
  
  <p>that ever I was born to set it right</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'd definitely start by feeding it older poetry, particularly poets that keep to strict meter. It's been a while since I've read Spencer and so forth, but I'd think poets of his time would be useful.  Dr. Seuss, perhaps the greatest wielder of the rhyming couplet, would surely be extraordinarily useful. </p>

<p>The evaluation method would have to be fuzzy, because there would be increasing degrees of variance the more modern the poetry, ultimately resulting in free structures, except in the case of forms such as rap, which strongly utilize regularized rhythm. Machine learning is all about estimation and reinforcement, and is proving to be extremely useful dealing with fuzziness.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is a great example of modern line of poetry: the floor of 13 syllables / 2 makes a 6 beat line.  Understanding that in context with the surrounding verse is much more difficult and illustrates the nature of the problem. Even scanning the poem correctly to that point to determine would be extremely difficult. </p>

<p>However, a different poem by the same author is extremely useful:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the late November doing / With the disturbance of the spring / And creatures of the summer heat, / And snowdrops writhing under feet / And hollyhocks that aim too high / Red into grey and tumble down / Late roses filled with early snow? / Thunder rolled by the rolling stars / Simulates triumphal cars / Deployed in constellated wars / Scorpion fights against the sun / Until the Sun and Moon go down / Comets weep and Leonids fly / Hunt the heavens and the plains / Whirled in a vortex that shall bring / The world to that destructive fire / Which burns before the ice-cap reigns</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All lines of roughly 8 syllables, easy to pick out because of capitalization.  But the real question is: ~136 13 lines of roughly 10 syllables, or 17 lines of roughly 8?  It would want to calculate based on word blocks (words that cross syllabic thresholds and at least tell you where the break <em>cannot</em> be, and it should be possible to statistically divine the pattern, at least for regularized verse.)  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The wounded surgeon plies the steel / That questions the distempered part; /
  Beneath the bleeding hands we feel / The sharp compassion of the healer's art 
  / Resolving the enigma of the fever chart.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This verse highlight the problem.  5 lines of 4 beats, but syllabically: 8, 8, 8, 10, 12.  </p>

<p>Most likely: </p>

<ul>
<li>46/5 = 9.2</li>
<li>46/4 = 11.5</li>
<li>46/6 = 7.66</li>
</ul>

<p>Less likely:</p>

<ul>
<li>46/3 = 15.3</li>
<li>46/2 = 23  </li>
<li>46/7 = 6.57</li>
</ul>

<p>2 lines has less perfect symmetry, but 5 lines is more likely, based on the overall number of syllables, and of the likely choices, has the least variance. </p>

<p>Ultimately it would be looking for the underlying structure, or lack of structure, and try to reorganize the unbroken text into something <em>close</em> to the original structure.  While exactness is not always required because the process is ultimately subjective, and currently intractable, certain wrong choices would yield disastrous results. </p>

<p>In the prior example it may be able to discern the likelihood of a 5 line pattern, but it would have to figure out on which lines to place the extra syllables.  Differentiating between particles and other parts of speech provides a clue, because the poet's language is very compact: there are 19 nouns, verbs, or prepositions.  </p>

<p>More likely:
 - 19/5 = 3.8
 - 19/4 = 4.75</p>

<p>Less likely:
 - 19/3 = 6.33
 - 19/6 = 3.16
 - 19/7 = 2.71</p>

<p>Further analysis might narrow it down.  But extremely regularized verse remains the best place to start.  7 lines of roughly 10 syllables is ""poetic"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘The aged man that coffers-up his gold<br>
  Is plagu’d with cramps and gouts and painful fits;<br>
  And scarce hath eyes his treasure to behold,<br>
  But like still-pining Tantalus he sits,<br>
  And useless barns the harvest of his wits;<br>
  Having no other pleasure of his gain<br>
  But torment that it cannot cure his pain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It cares about both X and Y values.</p>

<p>Initially you want to keep it to a single language, because syllables may be treated differently.  That said, having the AI look for something like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dactylic_hexameter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dactylic hexameter</a> would be extremely useful, because you could feed it Homer. You could also feed it Homer in English in many different forms of English meter, and in almost every other living language. By definition, the AI would value works such as these, because max number_of_translations provides the most robust data set. When it starts to value meaning, this will be especially important.</p>

<p>Understanding different ways of treating syllables(long/short vs. stressed/unstressed) will also be essential as it transitions into more modern poetry.  </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/meter.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here is a good link for basic English meter.</a>  Iambic and Trochaic meters will be easy, while meters that employ Anapests, Dactyls and Spondees will be more challenging. </p>

<p>In some cases, however, these will be mathematically interchangeable.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I went to the Garden of Love, / And saw what I never had seen: / A Chapel was built in the midst, / Where I used to play on the green. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn't matter if the lines above are iambic/trochaic or dactylic/anapestic, it's still 4 lines of roughly 8 syllables.  Thus ""I went to the Garden of Love"" is the same as ""The wounded surgeon plies the steel"", even though the beats for the lines are 3 and 4, respectively.</p>

<hr>

<p>It should also have a stanza marker, (possibly 00?). Because it looks for patterns within patterns, stanzas are valued.  Not all poetry has a stanza structure, but it arguably could. Deciding if stanzas are appropriate is partly a function of taking a syllabic divisor, breaking the poem down into number_of_lines, and looking at the divisors of that number. </p>

<p>It would need an added function to be able to recognize meaning patterns.  For instance, repetition of proper nouns is the marker of plays. (From a meaning perspective, imo, plays is the ideal place to start because the marker is so easy to learn, and names all belong to a single set, and imply communication. It's no different functionally than any other identifier, and a concept all computers ""understand"".)</p>

<p>Eventually it would want to look for phonetic patterns, rhymes and near rhymes, which would also be indicators of potential good places for line breaks.</p>

<p>There is a very big data set that it can look at, and who knows what it might discern?</p>

  <p>The main weaknesses of DL (as I see them) are: reliance on the simplest possible model neurons (“cartoonish” as LeCun calls them); use of ideas from 19th century Statistical Mechanics and Statistics, which are the basis of energy functions and log-likelihood methods; and the combination of these in techniques like backprop and stochastic gradient descent, leading to a very limited regime of application (offline, mostly batched, supervised learning), requiring highly-talented practitioners (aka “Stochastic Graduate Descent”), large amounts of expensive labelled training data and computational power. While great for huge companies who can lure or buy the talent and deploy unlimited resources to gather data and crunch it, DL is simply neither accessible nor useful to the majority of us.</p>

1593,1593,,,"<p>In that paper, Brooks introduced the basis for what became known as his ""subsumption architecture"".  The idea was to get away from the 1980's popular approach of a single global representation of all the components of the problem space that had required the task of robot task planning to juggle every  constraint in the world into one giant disordered mess of states and state transitions.  Rather than represent every element in the world in a single model (The Representation), Brooks suggested it was preferable to build a hierarchy of submodels of the world (subsets of states and transitions) in which smaller tasks could be more readily planned.  Then as these rudimentary skills were mastered, they could be combined to address a hierarchy of bigger and more complex tasks (bigger tasks subsume smaller tasks and benefit from their already having been solved).</p>

<p>Yes, representation did not fully go away, but it was redistributed hierarchically so that much of the state could be abstracted away from the higher level of the bigger problem that you need to solve.  Planning became like coordinating a hierarchical army of skills, where the general doesn't need to plan every movement of the private in order to manage a battle.  Instead, that general need only tell the colonels what to do, and the colonels tell the majors, and so on down to the privates.  Now the general solves problems by coodinating multiple sub-hierarchies available to him/her by delegating authority to coordinate behavior at the appropriate level of abstraction: like division, brigade, battalion, company, and squad.  That's Brooks' Subsumption Architecure: the general needs to represent a battle plan only as ""the world according to colonels"". </p>

Number of neurons in human brain can be matched memory-wise but the amount of parallelism to simulate it real-time cannot yet be achieved (at least for a random researcher).

<p>Deep Learning uses highly unstructured activations, i.e. the high level representations of ""dog"" and ""cat"" in a neural network classifier don't have to be similar at all.

<p>In Chapter 26, the textbook discussed ""technological singularity"". It quotes I.J. Good, who wrote in 1965:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultrainteltigent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an ""intelligence explosion,"" and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligeat machine is the <em>last</em> invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later on in the textbook, you have this question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>26.7 - I. J. Good claims that intelligence is the most important quality, and that building ultraintelligent machines will change everything. A sentient cheetah counters that ""Actually speed is more important; if we could build ultrafast machines, that would change everything"" and a sentient elephant claims ""You're both wrong; what we need is ultrastrong machines,"" What do you think of these arguments?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems that the textbook question is an implicit argument against I.J. Good. Good may be treating intelligence as valuable, simply because man's strengths lies in that trait called ""intelligence"". But other traits could be equally valued instead (speed or strength) and sentient beings may speculate wildly about their preferred traits being ""maximized"" by some machine or another.</p>

<p>This makes me wonder whether a singularity could occur if we had built machines that were <em>not</em> maximizing intelligence, but instead maximizing some other trait (a machine that is always increasing its strength, or a machine that is always increasing its speed). These types of machines can be just as transformative - ultrafast machines may solve problems quickly due to ""brute force"", and ultrastrong machines can use its raw power for a variety of physical tasks. Perhaps a ultra-X machine can't build another ultra-X machine (as I.J. Good treated the design of machines as an intellectual activity), but a continually self-improving machine would still leave its creators far behind and force its creators to be dependent on it.</p>

<p>So, let's repeat my question -- Are technological singularities limited to ultra-intelligences? Or technological singularities be caused by machines that are not ""strong AI"" but are still ""ultra""-optimizers?</p>

Now that you wanna learn some Chinese and you  excercise your right brain at the same time, so you closed your right eye and memorized a new character. After that, certainly you can recognize the new character with solely your right eye. But <em>why</em>?</p>

<p>The answer may be, the object / higher-level feature detection happens in a higher level cortex, which receives entire visual field. There may be also some transfer/one-shot learning taking place. But then, if a newborn baby trying to learn the low level visual features, he/she would definitely face the weight sharing problems.</p>

<p>A possible explanation would be, the baby will be exposed to very large amount of data and eventually learn invariance. Large amount of data reduces overfitting but doesn't guarantee <em>deterministic convergence</em>. If we train the same CNN model on the same dataset, however using <em>different random generator seeds</em>, there's a big chance the same feature detector will appear in a different channel, or a difference set of features appear as linear recombination.</p>

<p>If there's no way to share weights, the brain would learn <strong>a lot different feature combinations across the entire visual field, how does it still able to consistently solve visual invariance problem?</strong></p>

1625,1625,,,"<p>In the human brain every common pattern is recognised by a multitude of pattern recognisers (be they neurons or microcolumns). That's pretty obvious because neurons die all the time, but we don't wake up and have forgotten how to recognise the letter 'A'. In fact we have to take out rather big chunks of the neocortex until functionality degrades, which is why Alzheimer's patients show symptoms only when the brain is already visibly messed up. </p>

<p>Translational invariance within a level of the hierarchy has to be learned. Basically you need filters for the same edge all over your V1. An object moving across your field of vision only becomes invariant in it's representation on a higher level. Unfortunately we don't magically learn a representation that we can easily turn and twist, our ability to recognise objects from an unusual angle degrades with how uncommon the angle is. </p>

<p>A nice thought experiment to illustrate the point: Imagine a cube sitting in front of you. Now pull one of the corners of the cube upwards until the cube is dangling in front of you, one corner pointing straight to the ceiling, the opposite corner pointing to the ground. Now indicate with your finger where the rest of the corner are. </p>

<p>If you are anything like me, this is really difficult. I think the first time I did't even realise I had to point out six corners! </p>

<p>Of course this is 3D and we might still have inbuilt 2D invariance, but it also turns out that faces that are turned upside down have to be processed much higher into the cortex to be recognised as faces and so on ... </p>

<p>Concerning the learning of a lot of different feature vectors across the field of vision: This might be prevented by the fact that the neocortex learns sequences of input by predicting (via depolarisation) the next pattern. So you might have the situation that a higher level tells the lower level that there is an object moving from left to right and the lower level will predict that the edge it is detecting at point y will reoccur at point y+x.</p>

<p>This setup differs from the training of NNs in two ways: The data is already translational and the translation is predicted, which facilitates learning the same features. Basically two pattern recogniser close to each other get pretty much the same pattern one after the other whenever something moves in a certain direction and the second occurrence is predicted, which means it will be more likely detected, which means it will be learned. (I don't want to dole out a lecture about the cortex, but the prediction is a big deal because it allows neurons to fire quicker which means they beat other neurons before they are laterally inhibited and only if they actually fire will they learn.)</p>

<p>As a disclaimer I want to add that this is just my current understanding of the issue and I'm pretty sure the actual explanation is more complicated. For example I've read that one of the layers of the cortex is important for translational invariance and this layer only exists in the levels close to the sensory input. It is conjectured that this layer (L4) doesn't do the sequence prediction stuff, so maybe having the same kind of input is enough or learning different feature vectors is not actually a problem. There is also the complicating issue that there is poorly understood interplay between the different layers and different levels of the cortex. I would recommend to ask a neuroscientist, except I don't think they figured this out yet. </p>

<p>The neural network postulated have a sufficiently vast number of interacting elements and in effect do the combinatorics strictly, for each special case.

<p>In these cases it seems the time efficiency is obtained by resource inefficiency: by making the network enormous and simulating all the possible worlds then maximizing. So, while time to compute doesn't grow much as the problem grows, the size of the physical computer grows enormously for larger problems; how fast it computes is then, it seems to me, not a good measure of efficiency of the algorithm in the common meaning of efficiency. In this case the resources themselves only grow as fast as the problem size, but what explodes is the number of connections that must be built. If we go from 1000 to 2000 neurons to solve a problem twice as large and requiring exponentially as much time to solve, the algorithms requiring only twice as many neurons to solve in PT seem efficient, but really, there is still an enormous increase in connections and coefficients that need be built for this to work.</p>

<p>You definitely want to look into <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering#Philosophy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the concept of suffering in a philosophical context</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicurus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Epicurus</a> would be a very useful place to start.  </p>

<p>Epicurus is directly relevant in an algorithmic sense because he uses the term ""<a href=""http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ataracia&amp;la=greek#lexicon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ataraxia</a>"" meaning calm, and is derived from the verb ""<a href=""http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=tarassw&amp;la=greek"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tarasso</a>"" which means to agitate or disturb.</p>

<p>Ataraxia can be mathematically expressed as an equilibrium.  Tarasso can be mathematically expressed as disequilibrium.  </p>

<p>This relates directly to Game Theory in that disequilibrium can be said to be the primary requirements of games, and to AI in that Game Theory can be said to be the at root of all AI.</p>

<p>Ataraxia is also understood in the sense of ""freedom from fear"", which in temporal in that fear is a function of uncertainty as it relates to the future in a predictive sense, and involves current condition vs. possible, less optimal future conditions.  </p>

<p>Thus fear, which is a form of suffering, is rooted in computational intractability, even where the ""computer"" is is a human brain.</p>

<p>Early philosophers such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Democritus</a> are especially useful because they were exploring critical, fundamental concepts, many of which can now be expressed with modern mathematics.  </p>

<p><strong>The Singularity</strong> is the point in time when computers will be more intelligent,more able, and more creative than humans. 
At that point there will be a sharp bend in the technology curve, since super-intelligent computers will be able to develop new technologies exponentially faster than humans, including technologies to make themselves faster. After that, they will essentially be running the world.</p>

<p><strong>Hint on the future of Civilization;</strong> 
civilization has a specific set of ideas and customs, and a certain set of manufactures,science and arts that make it unique,with in a complex System.Therefore, Civilizations tend to develop intricate cultures, including a state-based decision making apparatus.Special thanks to <a href=""http://www.crystalinks.com/egyptscience.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">ancient Egyptians Civilization</a></p>

<p><strong>Artificial intelligence</strong> (AI) is the name of these technologies. 
AI technologies are under development in every country of the world, 
and they are the technologies that will bring about the Singularity. 
AI technologies are improving rapidly; in fact, 2015 was a breakthrough year for AI,with advances of all kinds. </p>

<p>These different advances are separate events now, but within a few years they'll merge into the first super-intelligent computers and robots that will lead to the Singularity. </p>

<p>Many analysts consider 2015 to have been a breakthrough year for Artificial Intelligence (AI), not because of any single achievement, 
but because of achievements across the board in so many different areas.</p>

<p>Companies like Google, Facebook and Microsoft are now operating their own AI labs.In areas such as image recognition, computer vision, face recognition, 
voice recognition and natural language processing, there are a wealth of new products (think of Siri or OK Google) that are becoming increasingly reliable and increasingly available.</p>

<p>Several companies are testing self-driving cars, 
and they’re expected to be available commercially by 2020. 
Robots in the military are becoming more common, from robots on wheels to pilotless drone warplanes. 
All of these robots still require constant human intervention and control, but they’re slowly migrating away from human control to algorithmically based decision making and control. 
Robot form factors are improving, with some robots looking almost human.</p>

<p><strong>Confusion from various sources</strong></p>

<p>Glimpse:Artificial Intelligence and Climate Change</p>

<p>Politicians and climate change activists like to say that the claims about climate change have been endorsed by 95% of all the scientists in the world. 
This claim is a total fraud, because it confuses two things.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First, we have the claims by science that the earth is warming because of human activity. Arguably, that has been proven by scientists. But that’s all.</p></li>
<li><p>The second part,is predictions about the future, which are mostly total crap, and certainly not science. In fact, climate change scientists have been making predictions for 25 years, and they’ve almost completely turned out to be wrong. 
The truth is that scientists who claim to know what the earth’s temperature will be in 2100 can’t even predict what the weather will be next month.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>During my lifetime in artificial Intelligence field and being passionate about, I’ve read number of hysterical environment disaster predictions articles,written by different philosophers across the globe.
My favorite is the prediction in 1970 by far left-wing Ramparts Magazine that predicted that the oceans were becoming so polluted that by 1980 the world’s oceans would be covered by a layer of algae. It didn’t happen.</p>

<p>One way to know that the climate change activists are wrong is that these climate change activists never mention the Singularity or future technology.</p>

<p>And we researchers in Artificial Intelligence,they undermine our visions which will pop out to be true.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Proof that the Singularity will occur by 2030 or 2040</strong></p>

<p>A proof, based on reasonable assumptions, 
that any intelligent species on any planet in the universe will develop in a way that’s similar to the development of humans,
including following the same Generational Dynamics cycles as humans.</p>

<p><strong>A glimpse:lets try to time travel back in 1800s,</strong></p>

<p>In the late 1800s, streets in large cities were full of horses (think of a traffic jam in any large city, with horses instead of cars). 
These horses were producing huge volumes of urine, manure, flies and carcasses — not to mention cruelty to horses.</p>

<p>By 1900, there was 1,200 metric tons of horse manure per day. 
There were international conferences (like today’s climate change conferences) that accomplished nothing. 
But within 20 years, the problem took care of itself because of new technology – the automobile.</p>

<p>History shows that new technology, including new AI technologies, will solve the “climate change” problem, 
and that politicians will have absolutely nothing to do with it, except to take the credit when something works, and to blame someone else otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>Now lets come back from 1800s;</strong>
Early in 2005, the Pentagon announced the Army's Future Combat Systems (FCS). 
By 2014, just a few years from now, America will be deploying thousands of computerized soldiers that will have the ability to decide on their own to kill people (hopefully, the enemy). </p>

<p>In early implementations, kills will be directed wirelessly by human overseers, but as millions of these are deployed, overseeing them will become increasingly impossible. 
By 2025, super-intelligent computerized robots manufactured in countries around the world will be fighting major battles. </p>

<p><em>By 2030, super-intelligent computers will be running the world without our help.</em></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Fiction or Facts from Science Fiction Movies:</strong>
Robot from I, Robot
This is quite a different view of intelligent robots than the one in the movie I, Robot. It came out in summer, 2004, 
and it portrays a world in 2035 when super-intelligent robots are being manufactured for domestic home use. 
These robots are designed to be unable to harm human beings, but the story line is about a rogue robot who may be violating that rule. 
In the end, Will Smith conquers the malevolent robots and gets the girl, and everyone lives happily ever after. </p>

<p><strong>Software algorithms that will bring singularity;</strong></p>

<p>Intelligence isn’t some magical, mystical force. 
It’s actually the ability to find new ways to combine previous experiences in new ways. 
A new discovery is made by combining old discoveries in new ways, 
in the same way that jigsaw puzzle pieces can be put together.</p>

<p>A computer can do the same thing by combining “knowledge bits” (KBs) in new ways, to learn new things, in the same way that jigsaw puzzle pieces can be combined. Computers can do this much faster than humans can.</p>

<p>Decisions can be made by using the same “minimax algorithm” that’s used to implement games like chess.
This algorithm would work today, except that computers aren’t yet fast enough. 
The speed of computers doubles every 18 months, 
and by 2030 computers will be fast enough to implement this IC algorithm.</p>

<p><strong>Another proof based on reasonable assumptions;</strong></p>

<p>Every intelligent species in the universe must follow the same Generational Dynamics cycles as humans.. 
is outlined as follows:</p>

<p>For any species (including humans) to survive, 
the population growth rate must be greater than the food supply growth rate. 
This is what I call “The Malthus Effect,” 
based on the 1798 book by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Robert_Malthus"" rel=""noreferrer"">Thomas Roberts Malthus</a>, Essay on Population.</p>

<p>Therefore, for any species, there must be cyclical periods of extermination. 
This can be accomplished in several ways, such as war, predator, famine or disease. But one way or another, it has to happen.</p>

<p>Non-intelligent species will simply starve and die quietly when there’s insufficient food. 
But intelligent species will form identity groups and hold riots and protests, and eventually go to war. 
These will be the cyclic crisis wars of extermination specified by Generational Dynamics and every intelligent species in the universe will have them.</p>

<p>If this can give you a glimpse,then just know Artificial Intelligence ain't no joke.....Lets study it hard...so that we see such a future.

<p>As the BlindKungFuMaster importantly notes, competitiveness will evolve as a trait if the AI operates in a partisan context.  </p>

<p>Yes in Kurzweil-like scenarios, where super-intelligence is an extension of human beings by technology (we are already in to some extent). Then control follows, as super-intelligence depends on us. It would extend our capabilities, such as speed of processing, extent of processing, etc. Even then control is debatable, as a remote-controlled killing machine would be part of a super-intelligent organism, partially human ""controlled"", partially autonomous.</p>

<p>No in ""Future of Life Institute""-like scenarios, where super-intelligence is independent from humans. The thinking is simple: What can we hope to do facing someone way more intelligent? The usual parallel is to compare this scenario with the arrival of the ""developed"" conquistadors in early America. Gunpowder vs. mere raw strength and arrows.</p>

<p>In it, I had developed a framework for extracting metadata from web-based educational content. This metadata was used for classifying the the educaitonal content for many different attributes, which could then be used for faster and more efficient search and discovery of educational content. </p>

<p>The educational resources (containing the content) could be anything like text or PDFs of assignments, homework, assignments, online books, exam questions, courses etc (which many colleges host online). To identify what kind of educational resource it is, I would parse the text and look for keywords and formatting styles (preprocessing included constructing 2-grams and 3-grams, POS tagging, using small specific parsers for NER, dates and other text entities one encounters in educational content). </p>

<p>For some part I used Wordnet (also available under python-nltk) to obtain relationships between different entities and also to find closeness between them. DBpedia was also used. However, for the most part I had to identify the most commonly occuring terms and build a taxonomy by hand. (It took a lot of time!). I obtained a lot of candidates for keywords by looking at openly available taxonomies.</p>

<p>For extracting domain specific taxonomy/ontology, one needs manually to build it.

<p>It seems fairly uncontroversial to say that NN based approaches are becoming quite powerful tools in many AI areas - whether recognising and decomposing images (faces at a border, street scenes in automobiles, decision making in uncertain/complex situations or with partial data)..... almost inevitably some of those uses will develop into situations where NN based AI takes on part or all of the human burden and generally does it better than people generally do.</p>

<p>Examples might include NN hypothetically used as steps in self driving cars, medical diagnosis, human/identity verification, circuit/design verification, dubious transaction alerting ... probably many fields in the next decade or so. </p>

<p>Suppose this happens, and is generally seen as successful (eg it gets diagnoses right 80% to human doctors' 65% or something, or cars with AI that includes an NN component crash 8% less than human driven cars or alternatives, or whatever...)</p>

<p>Now - suppose one of these aberrantly and seriously does something very wrong in one case. How can one approach it? With formal logic steps one can trace a formal decision process, but with NN there may be no formal logic, especially if it gets complex enough (in a couple of decades say), there are just 20 billion neural processors and their I/O weightings and connections, it may not be possible to determine what caused some incident even if lives were lost. It also may not be possible to say more than the systems continually learn and such incidents are rare. </p>

<p>I also haven't heard of any meaningful way to do a ""black box"" or flight recorder equivalent for NNs, (even if not used i  a life critical case), that would allow us to understand and avoid a bad decision. Unlike other responses to product defects, if a NN could be trained after the event to fix one such case, it doesn't clearly provide the certainty we would want, that the new NN setup has fixed the problem, or hasn't reduced the risk and balance of other problems in so doing. It's just very opaque. And yet, clearly, it is mostly very valuable as an AI approach.</p>

<p>So what's the answer? Is there one? In 20 years if NN is an (acknowledged as safe and successful) component in a plane flight or aircraft design, or built into a hospital system to watch for emergencies, or to spot fraud at a bank, and has as usual passed whatever regulatory and market requirements might exist and performed with a good record for years in the general marketplace, <em>and</em> then in one case such a system some time later plainly mis-acts on one occasion - it damgerously misreads the road, recommends life-damaging medications or blatantly missdiagnoses, or clears a blatant £200m fraudulent transaction at a clearing bank that's only caught by chance before the money is sent - what can the manufacturer do to address public or market concerns, or to explain the incident; what do the tech team do when told by the board ""how did this happen and make damn sure it's fixed""; what kind of meaningful logs can be kept, etc? Would society have to just accept that uncertainty and occasional wacky behaviour could be inherent (good luck with convincing society of that!)? Or is there some better way to approach logging/debugging/decision activity more suited to NNs?</p>

<p>There are a few options. One is to not use the GA as a direct classifier, but instead use a GA to learn the parameters of another classification model like a neural network.

<p>You would be able to implement this method most easily in MATLAB but you would also be able to do it in python with tensorflow or torch. You would probably be able to implement the trained Gaussian detector in tensorflow.</p>

<p>Method 2:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use a spatial transformer network to ""transform"" the image of the car for easy classification</li>
<li>Use the output of the spatial transformer network for classification via a convolutional neural network.</li>
<li>Use another neural network or a most common color algorithm to find the color of the car.</li>
</ol>

<p>This method would also work pretty well but using a spatial transformer network with a convolutional neural network may be hard to code because it is an area of developing research where there are many problems because the spatial transformer network and the convolutional neural network have to work well together and this is usually hard to get right.</p>

<p>Method 3:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use a convolutional neural network straight up on the input image maybe with down sampling to classify the car</li>
<li>Use another neural network to find the color of the car</li>
</ol>

<p>I would personally go with method #1 because it would be fairly simple to implement with existing libraries such as tensorflow and it would most likely provide a high accuracy. </p>

<p>As always I would also recommend that you use LIME during the development process to debug your model and determine what features you could add in or remove to help your model perform better.</p>

<p>**Edit*
Since you need to detect certain patterns on the cars for color classification I would recommend that you use a convolutional neural network to classify these patterns. So your method would now look like this:<br>
1. Use a spatial transformer network or a filtered Gaussian detector to filter out the car
2. Use a convolutional neural network to classify the make and model of the car.
3.  Use another neural network that has either a convolutional or deep architecture to classify patterns and solid colors. So the outputs would contain all of the colors that you want and all of the patterns that you want to detect.</p>

Some said deep learning will replace experts who were once very important in the old days(for feature engineering) in this field. It is said that two breakthroughs underlie the raise of deep learning: on the one hand, in neuralscience <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">neuroplasticity</a> tells us that like human brain which is highly plastic, artificial networks can be utilized to model almost all functions; on the other hand, the hardware is upgraded very quickly, in particular the introduction of GPU boosts the machine in a magnificent way, resulting in the models created decades ago becoming immensely powerful and versatile.  </p>

<p>Such developments bring computer vision into a new era, but in natural language processing and expert system the situation seems don't change very much. Neural networks can be harnessed in building knowledge base but it seems that hardly can the built knowledge base be used by neural network models. My questions are: 1) is knowledge base(for instance knowledge graph coined by Google) a promising branch in AI? If so, in what ways KB can empower machine learning?

<p>What you want to do is close to one-shot image recognition. You have not 1, but 3-4 examples of each car, but that is still a small amount, especially considering the car looks different from different angles (are you supposed to recognize them from any point of view, including sideways, rear, front, and 45 degrees etc.? maybe you also want to recognize them photographed from the top?).</p>

<p>One interesting article I found is: <a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition</a> by Koch, Zemel, and Salakhutdinov.</p>

<p>You may want to read other literature about the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-shot_learning"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">One-shot learning</a>.</p>

<p>One trick you can do is to utilize the fact that cars are symmetric, so you can double the number of learning examples by reflecting each image.</p>

<h3>Color</h3>

<p>Determining the color is not as simple as it seems. Your algorithm need to determine where is the car at your picture, and then determine the color, taking into account the lighting conditions, as well as light effects, most notably reflection. For example, consider the following image: <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JQae1.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JQae1.png"" alt=""""></a>.</p>

Instead FPGAs and CPUs are often used for that.</p>

1. Create and establish all hyper-parameters for a model such as a deep neural network

3. Save the weights that training on the GPU established so that the model can be deployed. 
4. Code the model in a production application with the optimal weights found in training. </p>

Also, if such a network is used as an agent's brain, the agent's response will be calculated immediately after receiving a set of stimuli.</p>

What is the main parameter to optimize the network for and what can be sacrificed?</p>

<p>In search or AI planning, for instance, standard languages like C++ and Java are often the first choice, because they are fast (in particular C++) and because many software projects like planning systems are open source, so using a standard language is important (or at least wise in case one appreciates feedback or extensions).

1707,1707,,,"<p>Yes, in fact neural networks (NNs) are very efficient at segmentation and it seems to me that your problem matches the capabilities of neural networks very well. </p>

<p>I think it best for you to truly understand what a NN is before using it. First, let's start with the architecture. A NN has 3 regions, the input layer, the hidden layers and the output layer. The input layer depends on the number of features in your dataset. The hidden layers, you can have multiple layers all of different breadth (number of nodes per layer). The output layer depends on the number of classes in your dataset. </p>

<p>An easy example is applying a NN to the MNIST datatset. This is a dataset which contains handwritten digits between 0-9. Let's assume each of these images is 16*16=256 pixels. Thus, you will need 256 input nodes. And you will need 10 output nodes, one for each possible output. The hidden layers can be set in any way you can creatively imagine. There are however ways to optimize your hidden layer to get the best performance possible while not spending too much computational power. </p>

<p>This is always how a NN works. The beauty of a NN is that you only need to code it once and it can learn any function. All you need to do is change your architecture, but the underlining principles will always be the same. </p>

<p>In your case, you want to do segmentation. This is often done using a window around the pixel you want to classify. Popular choices are 3*3 or 5*5 pixels. The choice of your considered window will determine the number of nodes in your input layer. Then you want to classify them as one of two classes, thus you need 2 output nodes. You can also use just 1, but I don't recommend it, I can expand on this if you care.</p>

<p>One caveat of NN is that you will need quite a bit of training data. So get ready to classify a lot of pixels manually. </p>

<p>How to know how many layers in hidden layer? How to know how many nodes per layer in the hidden layer?</p>

<p>In general, for simple operations like the one you are trying to learn you do not need to have multiple layers. One hidden layer should be enough, at most 2. But, how do you determine the number of nodes you should use? You need to use some model validation techniques to do this. One way is through grid search and cross-validation. Train, and re-train your model with multiple number of nodes and then compare their performances to identify the optimal number of nodes. To get good results this does require a large dataset.</p>

<p>Rule of thumb: 1 hidden layer for NN! Don't get dragged into deep models if you don't need them. </p>

<p>In a simple scenario, I think we can get very good performance by having a cascaded image classifier. For example 2 layers, the first identifies if the image contains a dog and a cat. The next layer, has two different CNNS, one trained to identify the breed of dog and the other one for cats. That way once we identify that we have a dog, the image can be sent to the correct CNN. A CNN that is trained specifically to detect the breed, thus being much more robust that a more generalized CNN. Kind of like a professional in the field. First the human identifies that he is looking at a dog then he consults a professional to ass him the breed. </p>

1714,1714,,,"<p>Deep learning allows you to not know the answer in order to ask the program a question.  Their main benefit is their finite ability and flexible nature.</p>

<p>The problem with procedural programing to solve problems is you have to know what the computer needs to do in order to solve the problem.</p>

<p>What deep learning does is remove the requirement of the programmer to know how to solve the problem by having them only need to know what the computer needs to know.</p>

<p>This is the entire premise of neural networks. The programmer writes the program for data points required to be known in order to solve a particular problem.</p>

<p>The computer is given an input it comes up with an answer.
If it's answer is wrong it needs to make the answer it gave less likely and the right answer more likely.
The goal is to get the computer to always get the right answer. If the computer always gets the wrong answer then the neural network it too small.</p>

<p>What deep learning is, is a neural network that is deep.
To answer this you need to know how a neural network is.</p>

<p>A neural network is based on a neuron:</p>

<ul>
<li>Finite number of `boolean' inputs (More then one)</li>
<li>A weight is attached on each input to define how important
often though as a float between -1 and 1, but it's just a percentage of how likely each input changes the answer.</li>
<li>One boolean output</li>
</ul>

<p>A neuron can be a class or function the implementation really doesn't matter. The weight of each input changes as more answers are asked and responses verified.</p>

<p>The depth of a neural network is has one layer  when there is one row of neurons between the input and output.
two layers when a few neurons make decisions on inputs and a final neuron or multiple neurons make decisions biased on those neurons.</p>

<p>A neural network is called deep when there are at least four layers of neurons? (do some research don't take my word for it <code>^_^</code>)</p>

<p>The disadvantage of deep learning is that it's ability is finite.
There is no way a deep neural network by it's self to get smarter then it's programed to be.
It has a intelligence curve similar to root time if it isn't improved somehow.
This leads to the other problem in neural networks. While the programmer has no need to know how decisions are made by the computer they still need to know what questions or nodes need to be added.
The reason this is a problem is if the nodes responsible aren't there the program will be wrong in strange cases and have no way of correcting this on it's own. The larger the network the harder it is to solve these kinds of problems.</p>

<p>This will lead to an inevitable solution to have the computer self improve by some type of generative algorithm.
This has it's own breadth of problems as if not built properly could grow into something unintended which wastes time and money if it fails quickly, and could be potentially dangerous if it appears to work and doesn't.</p>

<p>The answer to AI will be a combination of deep neural networks some generative type programing and some new ideas and innovations.</p>

<p>The wikipedia page discusses a bit about the <em>causes</em> of AI Winters. I'm curious however whether it is possible to <em>stop</em> an AI Winter from occurring. I don't really like the misallocation of resources that are caused by over-investment followed by under-investment.</p>

<p>One of the causes of the AI Winter listed on that Wikipedia page is ""hype"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The AI winters can be partly understood as a sequence of over-inflated expectations and subsequent crash seen in stock-markets and exemplified by the railway mania and dotcom bubble. In a common pattern in development of new technology (known as hype cycle), an event, typically a technological breakthrough, creates publicity which feeds on itself to create a ""peak of inflated expectations"" followed by a ""trough of disillusionment"". Since scientific and technological progress can't keep pace with the publicity-fueled increase in expectations among investors and other stakeholders, a crash must follow. AI technology seems to be no exception to this rule.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it seems that this paragraph indicates that <em>any</em> new technology will be stuck in this pattern of ""inflated expectations"" followed by disillusionment. So are AI Winters inevitable? That AI technologies will always be overhyped in the future and that severe ""corrections"" will always will always occur? Or can there a way to manage this Hype Cycle to stop severe increases/decreases in funding?</p>

<p>Although there are many opinions that differ, my own is that there is no absolute line to draw between something that is alive, and something that is not alive. A human is alive. But is a single bacterial cell, or a single cell from your own body? They reproduce, they eat, etc. so yes they are alive. They are not like a dog or a cat however. In fact, a bacterial colony in a pool of water, giving off a yellow or brown color can be mistaken as a mineral or mud. It is only when you look closer that you see it is actually life. What about a biological virus? It is not made of cells. It does not have DNA. Most would agree it has life. But is does not really seem to be as alive as say, a shark or giraffe. Many people do not think a car is alive. Yet cars evolve. They move, they ""eat."" </p>

<p>Life is simply a way we define things around us. A much more useful and definitive way to categorize life I think, would be to utilize a continuum instead of an all or nothing approach. Rocks would go on the end of ""nonliving."" Intelligent, multicellular; self-aware entities could perhaps be on the other end as ""fully alive.""</p>

<p>Other entities can go in between. As for something such as AI, I would propose adding a z-axis, to make a 3 dimensional continuum, allowing for a self aware, intelligence entity not made of cells to fit comfortably with humans without causing an all-or-nothing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Step One: Generate the initial population of individuals randomly. (First generation)</p>
  
  <p>Step Two: Evaluate the fitness of each individual in that population</p>
  
  <p>Step Three: Repeat the following regenerational steps until termination (time limit, sufficient fitness achieved, etc.):</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>Select the best-fit individuals for reproduction. (Parents)</p></li>
  <li><p>Breed new individuals through crossover and mutation operations to give birth to offspring.</p></li>
  <li><p>Evaluate the individual fitness of new individuals.</p></li>
  <li><p>Replace least-fit population with new individuals.</p></li>
  </ul>

<p>The ""individuals"" in this case are randomly-generated computer programs, which are then tested against a fitness function.</p>

<p>The comment above aside, as others have already mentioned, self-modifying code <em>is</em> one of the (many) techniques used in some applications of what can be called ""AI"".  So in that sense, the answer to your question in a very general sense is ""yes"".</p>

<p>But these days, the stuff that is state-of-the-art in machine learning / AI is usually more about finding sets of weights for functions that match a pattern or whatever.  In Neural Networks, for example, the NN isn't writing any code, it's just running through an algorithm that incrementally changes some weights (or coefficients) such that when you enter a certain input, you get an output that's close to the desired output.  </p>

<p>And then you have approaches like using a Genetic Algorithm to evolve the weights in the NN, as opposed to using back-propagation.  To the extent that GA's are a little closer to the idea of ""an AI coding itself"" (although not exactly), you could kinda sorta consider that an example of what you're asking about.</p>

So if you show an AI a video of a dog walking behind a table and briefly disappearing from the frame, it has pretty much no ability to apply ""common sense"" and know that the dog will reappear in a few seconds, and that if it does't reappear, it's probably because it found its favorite toy on the floor behind the table.  </p>
