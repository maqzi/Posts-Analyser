# Posts-Analyser
Post analysis (and possibly prediction) for questions/answers from Stack Overflow.


## Plan for Analysis of Posts

1. Get data into a Pandas Dataframe

2. Use the following to use as features

- Word count
- Readability index _(find the specifics)_
- Contains Source Code
- Contains Latex math
- Sentiment Analysis (Possibly predictive, but more intended for  descriptive)

3. Run a Predictive Analysis

4. Also Consider Descriptive Analysis of Different Stackexchange Communities.


### Readability Indices

Flesch-Kincaid Grade
Gunning Fog Index
Coleman-Liau Index
SMOG Index
Automated Readability Index
Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease
Spache Score
New Dale-Chall Score

### Datasets

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/transfer-learning-on-stack-exchange-tags/data)

[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange)
Currently testing work on AI and IOT data sets from Internet Archive. Should add more to extend analysis once we have a working model.

<!-- Evaulation for Grade
- type of dataset is important. better not to use kaggle
- do more feature engineering/data munging if you're using a cleaned up data set 
- get good results (better accuracy - it matters)
